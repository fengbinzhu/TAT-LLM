million after-tax , as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively , and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income , or oci .\n2 the decline in these remaining after-tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from december 31 , 2010 to december 31 , 2011 resulted primarily from amortization .\n3 the net unrealized amounts presented above excluded the remaining net unrealized losses related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity .\n4 excluding the securities for which other-than-temporary impairment was recorded in 2011 , management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining .\n5 we estimate , for example , that other-than-temporary impairment of the investment portfolio could increase by approximately $ 10 million to $ 50 million , if national housing prices were to decline by 37% ( 37 % ) to 39% ( 39 % ) peak-to-trough , compared to management 2019s expectation of 35% ( 35 % ) described above .\n6 impairment the following table presents net unrealized losses on securities available for sale as of december 31: .\n7 the credit component is recorded in our consolidated statement of income , and the non-credit component is recorded in oci to the extent that we do not intend to sell the security .\n8 overall , management 2019s expectation , for purposes of its evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment as of december 31 , 2011 , was that housing prices would decline by approximately 35% ( 35 % ) peak-to-trough .\n9 to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations , other-than-temporary impairment could increase , in particular , the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income .\n10 given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio , particularly mortgage- and asset-backed securities , to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks , the performance of the u.s .\n11 our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to management 2019s estimates of future cumulative losses .\n12 this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors , including , but not limited to , the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults .\n13 the combination of these factors has led to an increase in management 2019s overall loss expectations .\n14 as of september 30 , 2011 , national housing prices , according to the case-shiller national home price index , had declined by approximately 31.3% ( 31.3 % ) peak-to-current .\n15 the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages of securities continues to deteriorate .\n16 as such , our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices .\n17 to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified , the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component .\n18 refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 .\n19 housing market is a significant driver of the portfolio 2019s credit performance .\n20 generally , indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears .\n21 ultimately , other-than- temporary impairment is based on specific cusip-level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security .\n22 in addition , we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non-agency u.s .\n23 our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation , more fully described in note 3 , of economic and security-specific factors .\n24 in addition , management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above .\n25 to the extent that such factors differ substantially from management 2019s current expectations , resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated .\n26 we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists .\n27 residential mortgage-backed portfolio .\n28 such factors are based on estimates , derived by management , which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nin 2011 what was the amount of tax related to the unrealized losses reclassifications

contractual obligations as of december 31 , 2004 , is as follows: .\n2 our leverage , as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization , was 32 percent at the end of 2004 and the end of 2003 .\n3 reducing working capital is one of our major initiatives in 2005 .\n4 additionally , receivable balances were $ 21.2 million higher due to price increases associated with new product introductions in our water systems business and an increase in international sales , which tend to have longer payment terms .\n5 the $ 33.9 million increase in 2004 reflects $ 44.9 million higher receivable balances due to longer payment terms experienced by both of our businesses as well as higher sales levels in the fourth quarter .\n6 the $ 80.8 million increase in 2003 reflects $ 46.6 million higher inventory balances due primarily to extensive manufacturing repositioning in our electric motor business and several new product introductions and manufacturing consolidation in our water systems business .\n7 the proceeds of the notes were used to repay commercial paper and borrowing under the credit facility .\n8 to take advantage of historically low long-term borrowing rates , we issued $ 50.0 million in senior notes with two insurance companies in june 2003 .\n9 we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future .\n10 table of contents item 7 2013 management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources we recorded net earnings of $ 35.4 million or $ 1.18 per share in 2004 , compared with $ 52.2 million or $ 1.76 per share recorded in 2003 and $ 51.3 million or $ 1.86 per share in 2002 .\n11 net earnings recorded in 2004 were negatively impacted by cost increases to steel and freight , as well as manufacturing inefficiencies during the first nine months of the year in our ashland city plant and higher selling , general and administrative expense ( sg&a ) .\n12 as a result of the long-term nature of this facility , the commercial paper and credit line borrowings are now classified as long-term debt .\n13 we believe that our present facilities and planned capital expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in 2005 .\n14 we are projecting 2005 capital expenditures to be approximately $ 55 million , essentially the same as our projected 2005 depreciation expense .\n15 at december 31 , 2004 , we had available borrowing capacity of $ 153.9 million under this facility .\n16 in june 2004 , we completed a $ 265 million , five-year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks .\n17 despite lower earnings in 2004 , a smaller investment in working capital explains the majority of the improvement in cash flow compared with 2003 .\n18 the notes range in maturity between 2013 and 2016 and carry a weighted average interest rate of slightly less than 4.5 percent .\n19 while net earnings were flat in 2003 compared with 2002 , the lower earnings per share amount in 2003 as compared with 2002 reflected the full-year impact of our stock offering in may 2002 .\n20 the higher investment in working capital in 2003 ( as discussed above ) , explains the majority of the difference between 2003 and our capital expenditures were $ 48.5 million in 2004 , essentially the same as in 2003 and approximately $ 2.2 million higher than in 2002 .\n21 .\n22 the new facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings .\n23 the new facility expires on june 10 , 2009 , and it replaced a $ 250 million credit facility which expired on august 2 , 2004 , and was terminated on june 10 , 2004 .\n24 the increase in 2003 was associated with new product launches in our water systems business .\n25 cash provided by operating activities during 2004 was $ 67.2 million compared with $ 29.0 million during 2003 and $ 116.0 million during 2002 .\n26 finally , a $ 13.1 million increase in accounts payable balances was largely offset by $ 9.4 million in restructuring expenses paid out in 2003 .\n27 offsetting the increase in receivable balances were $ 13.5 million lower inventory levels split about equally between water systems and electrical products and $ 14.3 million higher accounts payable balances .\n28 our working capital , excluding short-term debt , was $ 339.8 million at december 31 , 2004 , compared with $ 305.9 million and $ 225.1 million at december 31 , 2003 , and december 31 , 2002 , respectively .\n29 our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat percentage of total aggregate contractual obligations is due to purchase

contents the estimated amortization expense at september 26 , 2015 for each of the five succeeding fiscal years was as follows: .\n2 assumptions used in the dcf require significant judgment , including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values , growth rates , and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows .\n3 to the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill , an impairment charge is recorded .\n4 the income approach is based on a dcf analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate .\n5 the forecasted cash flows are based on the company 2019s most recent budget and strategic plan and for years beyond this period , the company 2019s estimates are based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date .\n6 the market approach considers comparable market data based on multiples of revenue or earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( 201cebitda 201d ) and is primarily used as a corroborative analysis to the results of the dcf analysis .\n7 the residual amount from performing this allocation represents the implied fair value of goodwill .\n8 if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value , the company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss , if any .\n9 in performing the impairment test , the company utilizes the two-step approach prescribed under asc 350 .\n10 the discount rates used are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections and are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( 201cwacc 201d ) of market participants relative to each respective reporting unit .\n11 goodwill in accordance with asc 350 , intangibles 2014goodwill and other ( asc 350 ) , the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value .\n12 actual operating results and the related cash flows of the reporting units could differ from the estimated operating results and related cash flows .\n13 the company conducted its fiscal 2015 impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter , and as noted above used dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as of june 28 , 2015 , and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf approach in making its impairment test conclusions .\n14 the company conducted its fiscal 2014 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter , and as noted above used dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as of june 29 , 2014 , and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf approach in making its impairment test conclusions .\n15 the implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each reporting unit as of the measurement date and allocating the reporting unit 2019s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities .\n16 the user assumes all risks for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information , except to the extent such damages or losses cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law .\n17 to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for step 1 , the company primarily utilizes the income approach .\n18 events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include , but are not limited to , current economic and market conditions , including a decline in market capitalization , a significant adverse change in legal factors , business climate , operational performance of the business or key personnel , and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator .\n19 past financial performance is no guarantee of future results. .\n20 the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit 2019s goodwill to its carrying value .\n21 the company believes its assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses .\n22 the company believes its assumptions used to determine the fair value of its reporting units are reasonable .\n23 the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value .\n24 the company believes it used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue , cost projections , cash flows , market multiples and discount rates as source : hologic inc , 10-k , november 19 , 2015 powered by morningstar ae document research 2120 the information contained herein may not be copied , adapted or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate , complete or timely .\n25 for illustrative purposes , had the fair value of each of the reporting units that passed step 1 been lower than 10% ( 10 % ) , all of the reporting units would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test .\n26 at september 26 , 2015 , the company believes that each reporting unit , with goodwill aggregating 2.81 billion , was not at risk of failing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts .\n27 if different assumptions were used , particularly with respect to forecasted cash flows , terminal values , waccs , or market multiples , different estimates of fair value may result and there could be the potential that an impairment charge could result .\n28 the company believes it used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue , cost projections , cash flows , market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date .\n29 as a result of completing step 1 , all of the company's reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values , and as such , step 2 of the impairment test was not required .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat is the expected growth rate in amortization expense from 2016 to

of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest-rate environments .\n2 the following table presents var with respect to our trading activities , as measured by our var methodology for the periods indicated : value-at-risk .\n3 for the years ended december 31 , 2008 and 2007 , we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end-of-day var estimate .\n4 this information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled .\n5 our global treasury group has responsibility for managing state street 2019s day-to-day interest-rate risk .\n6 our overall interest-rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco .\n7 the use of derivatives is subject to alco-approved guidelines .\n8 in addition to on-balance sheet assets , we use certain derivatives , primarily interest-rate swaps , to alter the interest-rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities .\n9 we back-test the estimated one-day var on a daily basis .\n10 asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue , or nir , under varying economic environments , while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates .\n11 our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest-rate risk .\n12 to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related nir , global treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest-rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short-term and long-term time horizons .\n13 we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities , but we manage our overall interest-rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally-approved risk guidelines .\n14 finally , gap analysis 2014the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re-pricing within a specified time period 2014is used as a measurement of our interest-rate risk position. .\n15 additional information about our use of derivatives is in note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k under item 8 .\n16 most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses .\n17 dollar yield curves , which we include in our consolidated interest-rate risk management process .\n18 because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates , we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values .\n19 we invest in financial instruments with currency , repricing , and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest-rate risk position .\n20 global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units , north america , europe and asia/pacific , to reflect the growing , global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position .\n21 we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates .\n22 this growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non-u.s .\n23 as a result of growth in our non-u.s .\n24 dollar

the preferred stock was considered temporary equity .\n3 the total annual dividend requirements were approximately $ 3 million at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 .\n4 no gain or loss was recognized in net income as the transaction was not considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate .\n5 based on the preferred stockholders' ability to elect a majority of ipl's board of directors in this

plus cumulative preferred dividends .\n16 as such , the company recorded an adjustment of $ 5 million to retained earnings to adjust the preferred shares to their redemption value of $ 23 million .\n17 holders of the preferred stock are entitled to elect a majority of ipl's board of directors if ipl has not paid dividends to its preferred stockholders for four consecutive quarters .\n18 in october 2016 , dp&l redeemed all of its preferred shares .\n19 in april 2015 , cdpq invested an additional $ 214 million in ipalco , which resulted in cdpq's combined direct and indirect interest in

are netted within the same level and is included in counterparty netting in levels .\n3 where the counterparty netting is across levels , the netting is included in cross-level counterparty netting .\n4 range of significant unobservable inputs the following is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivative instruments : 2030 correlation .\n5 130 goldman sachs 2017 form 10-k .\n6 for example , the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads and oil spread inputs indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range .\n7 and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements in the tables above : 2030 the gross fair values exclude the effects of both counterparty netting and collateral netting , and therefore are not representative of the firm 2019s exposure .\n8 the broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs .\n9 2030 ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of derivative .\n10 2030 the ranges , averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative .\n11 significant unobservable inputs the table below presents the amount of level 3 assets ( liabilities ) , and ranges , averages and medians of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives .\n12 accordingly , the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in , or possible ranges of , fair value measurements of the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives .\n13 for example , volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks .\n14 2030 averages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional of the respective financial instruments .\n15 an average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average .\n16 in the table above : 2030 derivative assets are shown as positive amounts and derivative liabilities are shown as negative amounts .\n17 generally , cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type .\n18 for example , the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative .\n19 for example , option pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value .\n20 the goldman sachs group , inc .\n21 therefore , the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques .\n22 2030 the fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques .\n23 2030 oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products .\n24 2030 natural gas spread represents the spread per million british thermal units of natural gas .\n25 the ranges for credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers ( index and single names ) , regions , sectors , maturities and credit qualities ( high-yield and investment-grade ) .\n26 2030 credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates .\n27 ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets , maturities and strike prices .\n28 2030 volatility .\n29 ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type ( e.g. , equity index and equity single stock names ) and across product types ( e.g. , correlation of an interest rate and a currency ) , as well as across regions .\n30 2030 correlation within currencies and equities includes cross- product type correlation .\n31 2030 interest rates , currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models , credit derivatives are valued using option pricing , correlation and discounted cash flow models , and commodities derivatives are valued using

millions 2006 2005 2004 .\n2 consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 .\n3 consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity .\n4 coated paperboard net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2006 were higher than $ 1.3 billion in 2005 and $ 1.1 billion in 2004 .\n5 foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 .\n6 sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 .\n7 shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 .\n8 sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment .\n9 distribution our distribution business , principally represented by our xpedx business , markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in .\n10 in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix .\n11 average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 .\n12 sales volumes for u.s .\n13 earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2006 .\n14 in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 .\n15 operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 .\n16 foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume .\n17 shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix .\n18 sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products .\n19 average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board .\n20 raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste .\n21 entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols .\n22 compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix ( $ 14 million ) and other costs ( $ 21 million ) .\n23 operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices .\n24 operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs .\n25 average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january .\n26 the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight .\n27 average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages .\n28 containerboard export sales volumes are expected to decline due to scheduled first-quarter main- tenance outages .\n29 an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter .\n30 euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs .\n31 however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix .\n32 manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills .\n33 it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter .\n34 operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels .\n35 costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase .\n36 converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease .\n\n\n\n\n### Question

increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 .\n14 bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) .\n15 earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 .\n16 converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand .\n17 the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was market-related .\n18 average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 , principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp .\n19 operating profits in 2007 were $ 407 million , up from $ 327 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 170 million in 2005 .\n20 operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 .\n21 entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly .\n22 operating earnings in 2007 were $ 104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 .\n23 entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues .\n24 operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings .\n25 containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 , including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 .\n26 favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs .\n27 conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs .\n28 manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages .\n29 profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .\n30 manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter .\n31 however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy .\n32 u.s .\n33 raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly .\n34 margins improved reflecting stronger export demand .\n35 however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages .\n36 tissue pulp due to strong market demand , partic- ularly from asia .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat percentage of industrial packaging sales

segment results 20142009 compared to 2008 in 2009 , the segment 2019s net sales were $ 7.1 billion , a decrease of 41% ( 41 % ) compared to net sales of $ 12.1 billion in 2008 .\n2 in 2009 , the segment 2019s net sales represented 32% ( 32 % ) of the company 2019s consolidated net sales , compared to 40% ( 40 % ) in 2008 and 52% ( 52 % ) in 2007. .\n3 the decrease in the operating loss was primarily due to decreases in : ( i ) selling , general and administrative ( 2018 2018sg&a 2019 2019 ) expenses , primarily due to lower marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives , ( ii ) research and development ( 2018 2018r&d 2019 2019 ) expenditures , reflecting savings from cost-reduction initiatives , ( iii ) lower excess inventory and other related charges in 2009 than in 2008 , when the charges included a $ 370 million charge due to a decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms , and ( iv ) the absence in 2009 of a comparable $ 150 million charge in 2008 related to settlement of a purchase commitment , partially offset by a decrease in gross margin , driven by the 41% ( 41 % ) decrease in net sales .\n4 as a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 , gross margin and r&d expenditures increased and sg&a expenses decreased .\n5 the segment incurred an operating loss of $ 1.1 billion in 2009 , an improvement of 51% ( 51 % ) compared to an operating loss of $ 2.2 billion in 2008 .\n6 segment information the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in note 12 , 2018 2018information by segment and geographic region , 2019 2019 to the company 2019s consolidated financial statements .\n7 net sales and operating results for the company 2019s three operating business segments for 2009 , 2008 and 2007 are presented below .\n8 the 41% ( 41 % ) decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a 45% ( 45 % ) decrease in unit shipments , partially offset by an 8% ( 8 % ) increase in average selling price ( 2018 2018asp 2019 2019 ) .\n9 in indemnification cases , payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract , which procedures typically allow the company to challenge the other party 2019s claims .\n10 the segment 2019s net sales were negatively impacted by reduced product offerings in large market segments , particularly 3g products , including smartphones , and the segment 2019s limited product offerings in very low-tier products .\n11 in the opinion of management , the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company 2019s consolidated financial position , liquidity or results of operations .\n12 further , the company 2019s obligations under these agreements for indemnification based on breach of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration , typically not more than 24 months , and for amounts not in excess of the contract value , and in some instances the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company .\n13 on a product technology basis , net sales decreased substantially for gsm , cdma and 3g technologies , partially offset by an increase in net sales for iden technology .\n14 management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations indemnification provisions : in addition , the company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial , intellectual property and divestiture agreements .\n15 legal matters : the company is a defendant in various lawsuits , claims and actions , which arise in the normal course of business .\n16 on a geographic basis , net sales decreased substantially in latin america , the europe , middle east and african region ( 2018 2018emea 2019 2019 ) and asia and , to a lesser extent , decreased in north america .\n17 therefore , it is vital to the segment 2019s success that new , compelling products are continually introduced .\n18 the segment 2019s industry typically experiences short life cycles for new products .\n19 however , there is an increasing risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the current legal climate .\n20 mobile devices segment the mobile devices segment designs , manufactures , sells and services wireless handsets , including smartphones , with integrated software and accessory products , and licenses intellectual property .\n21 accordingly , a strong commitment to .\n22 historically , the company has not made significant payments under these agreements , nor have there been significant claims

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured .\n8 at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics .\n9 for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made .\n10 the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 .\n11 we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment .\n12 for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers .\n13 to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method .\n14 since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets .\n15 these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs .\n16 if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired .\n17 the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value .\n18 2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 .\n19 we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years .\n20 title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction .\n21 for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience .\n22 we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so .\n23 we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s .\n24 gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods .\n25 the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s .\n26 to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry .\n27 we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year .\n28 management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use .\n29 benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) .\n30 the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial .\n31 these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates .\n32 the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee .\n33 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review .\n34 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions .\n35 and non- u.s .\n36 we anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s .\n37 as permitted by u.s .\n38 gaap .\n39 gaap .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat is the percentage change in the weighted-average discount rate for u.s . pension plans from 2014 to 2015?\n\n\n\n### Response", "resp": "The answer is: 0.08861"}, {"id": "AON/2009/page_48.pdf-4", "user_prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a question answering task in the finance domain, paired with an input table and its relevant text that provide further context.

2016 , 2015 , and 2014 the following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated ( in millions ) : .\n2 however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty .\n3 the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016 .\n4 sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 was $ 1.4 billion and $ 32 million , respectively .\n5 the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded .\n6 however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group .\n7 prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter , the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell .\n8 the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $ 1.1 billion .\n9 it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material , but cannot be estimated as of december 31 , 2016 .\n10 upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul .\n11 while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits .\n12 the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016 .\n13 prior to its classification as discontinued operations , sul was reported in the brazil sbu reportable segment .\n14 discontinued operations brazil distribution 2014 due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016 , management has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , aes sul and eletropaulo .\n15 aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business , including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance .\n16 sul 2019s pretax gain attributable to aes for the year ended december 31 , 2014 was $ 133 million .\n17 on october 31 , 2016 , the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $ 484 million , excluding contingent consideration .\n18 wind projects which were each sold in the first half of cameroon 2014 in september 2013 , the company executed agreements for the sale of its 56% ( 56 % ) equity interests in businesses in cameroon : sonel , an integrated utility , kribi , a gas and light fuel oil plant , and dibamba , a heavy .\n19 the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years .\n20 this includes the reclassification of approximately $ 1 billion of cumulative translation losses , resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $ 92 million .\n21 in december 2016 , eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to , among other things , provide more liquidity of its shares .\n22 we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented .\n23 our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted .\n24 as discussed in note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies , effective july 1 , 2014 , the company prospectively adopted asu no .\n25 upon disposal of aes sul , we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $ 737 million .\n26 2014-08 include the results of cameroon , saurashtra and various u.s .\n27 discontinued operations prior to adoption of asu no .\n28 2014-08 .\n29 22 .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was the percentage change in the unrecognized tax benefits from 2015 to 2016?\n\n\n\n### Response", "resp": "The answer

2011 and 2010 , respectively .\n3 in june 2011 , the epa selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of $ 46 million .\n4 the suit alleges that a mill , during the time it was allegedly owned and operated by st .\n5 in addition to the above matters , other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company 2019s current , closed or formerly-owned facilities , and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet , totaled approximately $ 46 million at december 31 , 2012 .\n6 also in connection with the kalamazoo river superfund site , the company was named as a defendant by georgia-pacific consumer products lp , fort james corporation and georgia pacific llc in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the kalamazoo river super- fund site .\n7 in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy deci- sion would be delayed .\n8 international paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately $ 92 million in the aggregate at december 31 , 2012 .\n9 international paper has not received any orders from the epa with respect to the site and is in the process of collecting information from the epa and other parties relative to the kalamazoo river superfund site to evaluate the extent of its liability , if any , with respect to the site .\n10 in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to per- form a natural resource damage assessment .\n11 guarantees in connection with sales of businesses , property , equipment , forestlands and other assets , interna- tional paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets , and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities , breaches of representations

material , and sig- nificantly higher than amounts currently recorded .\n13 also named as defendants in the suit are ncr corporation and weyerhaeuser company .\n14 at december 31 , 2012 , total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operat- ing leases and purchase obligations were as follows: .\n15 the suit seeks contribution under cercla for $ 79 million in costs purportedly

is a successor in interest to st .\n18 remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable .\n19 environmental proceedings international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws , includ- ing the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act ( cercla ) .\n20 regis , discharged pcb contaminated solids and paper residuals resulting from paper de-inking and recycling .\n21 while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws , as a practical matter , liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties .\n22 the overall remediation reserve for the site is currently $ 48 mil- lion to address this selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy .\n23 the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the allied paper , inc./portage creek/ kalamazoo river superfund site ( kalamazoo river superfund site ) in michigan .\n24 where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation , accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction .\n25 one of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake , minneso- ta .\n26 the epa asserts that the site is contaminated primarily by pcbs as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the river , including a paper mill formerly owned by st .\n27 during 2009 , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla , international paper submitted to the epa a site remediation feasi- bility study .\n28 it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred .\n29 many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources .\n30 accordingly , it is pre- mature to estimate a loss or range

significant unobservable inputs ( average/median ) as of december $ in millions 2017 2016 .\n2 2030 counterparty netting is reflected in each level to the extent that receivable and payable balances are netted within the same level and is included in counterparty netting in levels .\n3 2030 credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates .\n4 where the counterparty netting is across levels , the netting is included in cross-level counterparty netting .\n5 for example , the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads and oil spread inputs indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range .\n6 the ranges for credit spreads , upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers ( index and single names ) , regions , sectors , maturities and credit qualities ( high-yield and investment-grade ) .\n7 range of significant unobservable inputs the following is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivative instruments : 2030 correlation .\n8 130 goldman sachs 2017 form 10-k .\n9 and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements in the tables above : 2030 the gross fair values exclude the effects of both counterparty netting and collateral netting , and therefore are not representative of the firm 2019s exposure .\n10 the broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs .\n11 2030 ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of derivative .\n12 2030 the ranges , averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative .\n13 significant unobservable inputs the table below presents the amount of level 3 assets ( liabilities ) , and ranges , averages and medians of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives .\n14 accordingly , the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in , or possible ranges of , fair value measurements of the firm 2019s level 3 derivatives .\n15 for example , volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks .\n16 2030 averages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional of the respective financial instruments .\n17 an average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average .\n18 in the table above : 2030 derivative assets are shown as positive amounts and derivative liabilities are shown as negative amounts .\n19 generally , cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type .\n20 for example , the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative .\n21 for example , option pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value .\n22 the goldman sachs group , inc .\n23 2030 interest rates , currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models , credit derivatives are valued using option pricing , correlation and discounted cash flow models , and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models .\n24 therefore , the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques .\n25 2030 the fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques .\n26 2030 oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products .\n27 2030 natural gas spread represents the spread per million british thermal units of natural gas .\n28 ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets , maturities and strike prices .\n29 2030 volatility .\n30 ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type ( e.g. , equity index and equity single stock names ) and across product types ( e.g. , correlation of an interest rate and a currency ) , as well as across regions .\n31 2030 correlation within currencies and equities includes cross- product type correlation .\n32 2030 derivative assets are shown as positive amounts and derivative liabilities are shown as negative amounts .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat is the

comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities .\n7 proportional free cash flow ( a non-gaap measure ) we define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures ( including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures ) , adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests .\n8 the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation .\n9 the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations .\n10 proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities , which is determined in accordance with gaap .\n11 ( 1 ) service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-gaap metric .\n12 we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company , as it measures the cash generated by the business , after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures , that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes .\n13 the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below .\n14 the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur .\n15 proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed , such as debt service requirements and dividend payments .\n16 our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies .\n17 the company adopted service concession accounting effective january 1 , 2015 .\n18 ( 3 ) includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $ 84 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 .\n19 upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1 , 2015 , capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities .\n20 factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests , where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company .\n21 assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) .\n22 see note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10-k for further information on the adoption of this guidance .\n23 an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker .\n24 thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest .\n25 for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary .\n26 see item 1 . 2014us sbu 2014ipl 2014environmental matters for details of these investments .\n27 we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory , contractual or other mechanisms .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was the percentage change in proportional free cash flow between

$ 85 .\n5 2015 pension expense , excluding special items , decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost , the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains , partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans .\n6 ( a ) effective in 2016 , the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows , as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs .\n7 2014 the decrease in pension expense , excluding special items , was due to the impact from expected return on assets , a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption , and lower service cost and interest cost .\n8 2017 outlook in 2017 , pension expense , excluding special items , is estimated to be approximately $ 70 to $ 75 , an increase of $ 10 to $ 15 from 2016 , resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates , offset by favorable asset experience , effects of the versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables .\n9 the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses , which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate .\n10 future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017 .\n11 with respect to funded plans , our

quarter of 2017 , the company expects to record a curtailment loss estimated to be $ 5 to $ 10 related to employees transferring to versum .\n19 in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all

the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty .\n3 the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded .\n4 sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 was $ 1.4 billion and $ 32 million , respectively .\n5 however , the

expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures .\n2 beginning in the quarter ended march 31 , 2015 , the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows .\n3 calculation of proportional free cash flow ( in millions ) 2015 2014 2013 2015/2014change 2014/2013 change .\n4 the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities .\n5 proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities , which is determined in accordance with gaap .\n6 assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) .\n7 our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies .\n8 factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests , where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company .\n9 proportional free cash flow ( a non-gaap measure ) we define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures ( including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures ) , adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests .\n10 upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1 , 2015 , capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities .\n11 we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company , as it measures the cash generated by the business , after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures , that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes .\n12 the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below .\n13 ( 4 ) excludes ipl's proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $ 205 million , $ 163 million and $ 110 million for the years december 31 , 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. .\n14 the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation .\n15 the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur .\n16 the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below .\n17 the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations .\n18 an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker .\n19 ( 1 ) service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-gaap metric .\n20 proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed , such as debt service requirements and dividend payments .\n21 the company adopted service concession accounting effective january 1 , 2015 .\n22 ( 3 ) includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $ 84 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 .\n23 thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest .\n24 for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary .\n25 see item 1 . 2014us sbu 2014ipl 2014environmental matters for details of these investments .\n26 we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory , contractual or other mechanisms .\n27 see note 1 2014general and summary of

, $ 92 million of which was incurred during 2003 .\n2 as of september 27 , 2003 , the retail segment had approximately 1300 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $ 354 million .\n3 the retail segment has also contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals , software and services experienced by the company during 2003 .\n4 investment in a new business model such as the retail segment is inherently risky , particularly in light of the significant investment involved , the current economic climate , and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the retail segment 2019s operating expenses .\n5 as measured by the company 2019s operating segment reporting , the retail segment improved from a loss of $ 22 million during 2002 to a loss of $ 5 million during 2003 .\n6 this decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several macintosh models instituted by the company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry , lower sales of relatively higher margin power macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003 , and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new power mac g5 and 15-inch powerbook , both of which began shipping in volume during september 2003 .\n7 the aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales .\n8 during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 , the company opened 9 additional stores including its first international store in the ginza in tokyo , japan .\n9 however , in the case of japan the increase in imac unit shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the company in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above .\n10 with an average of 54 stores open during 2003 , the retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $ 11.5 million , as compared to approximately $ 10.2 million based on an average of 28 stores open in 2002 .\n11 the retail segment 2019s net sales grew to $ 621 million during 2003 from $ 283 million in 2002 and from $ 19 million in 2001 .\n12 during 2003 , approximately 45% ( 45 % ) of the retail segment 2019s net sales came from the sale of apple-branded and third-party peripherals , software and services as compared to 28% ( 28 % ) for the company as a whole .\n13 the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores .\n14 the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions , price competition in the personal computer industry , and potential increases in component pricing .\n15 24 of 93 net sales in japan remained flat during 2002 versus 2001 , with a slight decline in unit sales of 2% ( 2 % ) .\n16 retail the company opened 25 new retail stores during 2003 , bringing the total number of open stores to 65 as of september 27 , 2003 , which compares to 40 open stores as of september 28 , 2002 and 8 open stores as of september 29 , 2001 .\n17 gross margin gross margin for the three fiscal years ended september 27 , 2003 are as follows ( in millions , except gross margin percentages ) : .\n18 the $ 338 million or 119% ( 119 % ) increase in net sales during 2003 reflects the impact from opening 25 new stores in 2003 , the full year impact of 2002 store openings , as well as an increase in average revenue per store .\n19 consistent with the company 2019s other geographic operating segments , during 2002 japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of power macintosh systems .\n20 expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure , operating lease commitments , personnel , and other operating expenses .\n21 gross margin decreased to 27.5% ( 27.5 % ) of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% ( 27.9 % ) of net sales in 2002 .\n22 the company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the power mac g5 and other products during 2004 .\n23 this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment 2019s year-over-year increase in net sales , which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy , depreciation and other fixed costs .\n24 the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin during 2004 , general demand for personal computers , anticipated industry component pricing , anticipated air freight charges , and future economic conditions are forward-looking .\n25 such costs could adversely affect the company 2019s results of operations and financial condition .\n26 this decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed .\n27 total macintosh sales increased by approximately $ 170 million of which $ 108 million related to year-over-year increases in powerbook sales .\n28 additionally , net sales in japan on a sequential and year-over-year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions in japan .\n29 japan 2019s imac unit sales increased 85% ( 85 % ) in 2002 .\n30 in general , gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under .\n31 there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained , targeted gross margin levels will be achieved , or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat were capital expenditures associated with the retail segment since its inception , exclusive of the amount incurred during 2003 , in

prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity .\n4 foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 .\n5 sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 .\n6 coated paperboard net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2006 were higher than $ 1.3 billion in 2005 and $ 1.1 billion in 2004 .\n7 shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 .\n8 average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 .\n9 sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment .\n10 distribution our distribution business , principally represented by our xpedx business , markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in .\n11 in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix .\n12 sales volumes for u.s .\n13 foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume .\n14 in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 .\n15 operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 .\n16 shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix .\n17 raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste .\n18 operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs .\n19 earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2006 .\n20 sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products .\n21 compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix ( $ 14 million ) and other costs ( $ 21 million ) .\n22 average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board .\n23 operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices .\n24 average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january .\n25 the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight .\n26 entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols .\n27 average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages .\n28 containerboard export sales volumes are expected to decline due to scheduled first-quarter main- tenance outages .\n29 an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter .\n30 euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs .\n31 however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix .\n32 operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels .\n33 manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills .\n34 it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter .\n35 costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase .\n36 converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease

financing activities for the year ended 2014 , cash used by financing activities was $ 504.3 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $ 627.7 , which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $ 141.6 .\n19 additions to plant and equipment are largely in support of the merchant gases and tonnage gases businesses .\n20 it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations .\n21 certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases , and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities , if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease .\n22 in the fourth quarter , we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in guiyang , china .\n23 additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine , ongoing nature , including

, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .\n3 during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest .\n4 our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal .\n5 see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information .\n6 additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .\n7 typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .\n8 a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification .\n9 the following tables provide the number of

evaluated for a modification under a government program .\n22 78 the pnc financial services group , inc .\n23 temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs .\n24 generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated .\n25 if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .\n26 further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs .\n27 permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .\n28 at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr .\n29

compared to 2008 in 2009 , the segment 2019s net sales were $ 7.1 billion , a decrease of 41% ( 41 % ) compared to net sales of $ 12.1 billion in 2008 .\n3 the 41% ( 41 % ) decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a 45% ( 45 % ) decrease in unit shipments , partially offset by an 8% ( 8 % ) increase in average selling price ( 2018 2018asp 2019 2019 ) .\n4 net sales and operating results for the company 2019s three operating business segments for 2009 , 2008 and 2007 are presented below .\n5 the decrease in the operating loss was primarily due to decreases in : ( i ) selling , general and administrative ( 2018 2018sg&a 2019 2019 ) expenses , primarily due to lower marketing expenses and savings from cost-reduction initiatives , ( ii ) research and development ( 2018 2018r&d 2019 2019 ) expenditures , reflecting savings from cost-reduction initiatives , ( iii ) lower excess inventory and other related charges in 2009 than in 2008 , when the charges included a $ 370 million charge due to a decision to consolidate software and silicon platforms , and ( iv ) the absence in 2009 of a comparable $ 150 million charge in 2008 related to settlement of a purchase commitment , partially offset by a decrease in gross margin , driven by the 41% ( 41 % ) decrease in net sales .\n6 in the opinion of management , the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse

smartphones , and the segment 2019s limited product offerings in very low-tier products .\n10 further , the company 2019s obligations under these agreements for indemnification based on breach of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration , typically not more than 24 months , and for amounts not in excess of the contract value , and in some instances the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company .\n11 as a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 , gross margin and r&d expenditures increased and sg&a expenses decreased .\n12 on a product technology basis , net sales decreased substantially for gsm , cdma and 3g technologies , partially offset by an increase in net sales for iden technology .\n13

2018emea 2019 2019 ) and asia and , to a lesser extent , decreased in north america .\n16 the segment incurred an operating loss of $ 1.1 billion in 2009 , an improvement of 51% ( 51 % ) compared to an operating loss of $ 2.2 billion in 2008 .\n17 historically , the company has not made significant payments under these agreements , nor have there been significant claims asserted against the company .\n18 the segment 2019s industry typically experiences short life cycles for new products .\n19 however , there is an increasing risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the

the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce .\n9 heavier and higher sulfur crude oil ( commonly referred to as heavy sour crude oil ) sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil .\n10 key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel , which track commodity markets such as the canadian aeco natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively .\n11 the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed , and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime .\n12 later in 2008 ,

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured .\n14 at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics .\n15 for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made .\n16 the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 .\n17 for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers .\n18 these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs .\n19 2022 employee benefit plans -

2015/2014change 2014/2013 change .\n2 ( 4 ) excludes ipl's proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $ 205 million , $ 163 million and $ 110 million for the years december 31 , 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. .\n3 ( 2 ) the proportional adjustment factor , proportional maintenance capital expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures .\n4 the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below .\n5 beginning in the quarter ended march 31 , 2015 , the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows .\n6 the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities .\n7 proportional free cash flow ( a non-gaap measure ) we define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures ( including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures ) , adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests .\n8 the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation .\n9 the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations .\n10 proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities , which is determined in accordance with gaap .\n11 ( 1 ) service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-gaap metric .\n12 we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company , as it measures the cash generated by the business , after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures , that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes .\n13 the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below .\n14 the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur .\n15 proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed , such as debt service requirements and dividend payments .\n16 our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies .\n17 factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests , where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company .\n18 assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) .\n19 see note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10-k for further information on the adoption of this guidance .\n20 upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1 , 2015 , capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities .\n21 ( 3 ) includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $ 84 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 .\n22 an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker .\n23 the company adopted service concession accounting effective january 1 , 2015 .\n24 thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest .\n25 for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary .\n26 see item 1 . 2014us sbu 2014ipl 2014environmental matters for details of these investments .\n27 we also exclude environmental

$ 205 million , $ 163 million and $ 110 million for the years december 31 , 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. .\n2 calculation of proportional free cash flow ( in millions ) 2015 2014 2013 2015/2014change 2014/2013 change .\n3 ( 3 ) includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $ 84 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 .\n4 ( 2 ) the proportional adjustment factor , proportional maintenance capital expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures .\n5 an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker .\n6 the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below .\n7 proportional free cash flow ( a non-gaap measure ) we define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures ( including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures ) , adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests .\n8 beginning in the quarter ended march 31 , 2015 , the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows .\n9 the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation .\n10 the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below .\n11 upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1 , 2015 , capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities .\n12 we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company , as it measures the cash generated by the business , after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures , that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes .\n13 we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory , contractual or other mechanisms .\n14 the company adopted service concession accounting effective january 1 , 2015 .\n15 the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur .\n16 factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests , where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company .\n17 see note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10-k for further information on the adoption of this guidance .\n18 ( 1 ) service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-gaap metric .\n19 proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed , such as debt service requirements and dividend payments .\n20 proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities , which is determined in accordance with gaap .\n21 the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities .\n22 assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) .\n23 the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations .\n24 see item 1 . 2014us sbu 2014ipl 2014environmental matters for details of these investments .\n25 for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary .\n26 our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies .\n27 thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat were average proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures

affected negatively by a sudden and unanticipated increase in short-term rates paid on its liabilities ( e.g. , depos- its ) without a corresponding increase in long-term rates re- ceived on its assets ( e.g. , loans ) .\n2 for example , if more deposit liabilities are repricing than assets when general interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially .\n3 earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change in the firm 2019s net interest income , and the corresponding impact to the firm 2019s pretax earnings , over the following 12 months .\n4 2022 the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets , liabili- ties or off 2013balance sheet instruments as interest rates change .\n5 for example , if more borrowers than forecasted pay down higher-rate loan balances when general interest rates are de- clining , earnings may decrease initially .\n6 jpmorgan chase 2019s 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profile as of december 31 , 2009 and 2008 , is as follows. .\n7 conversely , higher long-term rates received on assets generally are beneficial to earnings , particularly when the increase is not accompanied by rising short-term rates paid on liabilities .\n8 the change in earnings at risk from december 31 , 2008 , results from a higher level of afs securities and an updated baseline scenario that uses higher short-term interest rates .\n9 for example , if liabilities reprice quicker than assets and funding interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially .\n10 2022 differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change ( for example , changes in the slope of the yield curve , because the firm has the ability to lend at long-term fixed rates and borrow at variable or short- term fixed rates ) .\n11 the increase in earnings is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates , with funding costs remaining unchanged .\n12 jpmorgan chase & co./2009 annual report 131 earnings-at-risk stress testing the var and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of the firm 2019s consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables .\n13 these tests highlight exposures to various rate-sensitive factors , such as the rates themselves ( e.g. , the prime lending rate ) , pricing strate- gies on deposits , optionality and changes in

target rate of zero , and negative three- and six-month treasury rates .\n15 business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury through a transfer- pricing system , which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets .\n16 interest rate risk exposure in the firm 2019s core nontrading business activities ( i.e. , asset/liability management positions ) results from on 2013and off 2013balance sheet positions and can occur due to a variety of factors , including : 2022 differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments .\n17 limits reflect the firm 2019s risk appetite in the context of the market environment and business strategy .\n18 the firm 2019s risk to rising rates is largely the result of increased funding costs on assets , partially offset by widening deposit margins , which are currently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates .\n19 additionally , another interest rate scenario , involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 100 basis points and short- term rates staying at current levels , results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of $ 449 million .\n20 2022 differences in the amounts of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments that are repricing at the same time .\n21 these scenarios include the implied forward curve , nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates .\n22 the effect of interest rate exposure on reported net income is also important .\n23 immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk , and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed .\n24 the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated , corporate-wide basis .\n25 the firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income from its nontrading activities under a variety of interest rate scenarios .\n26 in setting limits , the firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility , product liquidity , business trends and management experience. .\n27 the earnings- at-risk results of such a low-probability scenario are not meaningful .\n28 management of trading businesses control rifle entries , thereby permitting the firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not adequately covered by standard risk measures .\n29 these scenar- ios are intended to provide a comprehensive view of jpmorgan chase 2019s earnings at risk over a wide range of outcomes .\n30 this

expected prepayment experience , interest rate reset dates and maturities , rate indices used for repricing , and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products .\n32 the tests include forecasted balance sheet changes , such as asset sales and securitizations , as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior .\n33 risk identification for large exposures individuals who manage risk positions , particularly those that are complex , are responsible for identifying potential losses that could arise from specific , unusual events , such as a potential tax change , and

transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income .\n3 for those structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 277 million as of december 31 , 2008 and $ 7 million as of december 31 , 2007 .\n4 changes in fair value of these

.\n14 these positions will continue to be classified as debt , deposits or derivatives ( trading account liabilities ) on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form

companies , which are reported at fair value .\n16 the changes in fair value for the years ended december 31 , 2008 and 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of $ 38 million

amounts 90 days or more past due or on a non-accrual status at december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 .\n20 significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term , or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party .\n21 citigroup has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications .\n22 other items for which the fair-value option was selected in accordance with sfas 159 the company has elected the fair-value option for the following eligible items , which did not affect opening retained earnings : 2022 certain credit products ; 2022 certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity-method investments ; 2022 certain structured liabilities ; 2022 certain non-structured liabilities ; and 2022 certain mortgage loans certain credit products citigroup has elected the fair-value option for certain originated and purchased loans , including certain unfunded loan products , such as guarantees and letters of credit , executed by citigroup 2019s trading businesses .\n23 the company elected fair-value accounting to reduce operational and accounting complexity .\n24 fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the company , including where those management objectives would not be met .\n25 certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity method investments citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation .\n26 certain structured liabilities the company has elected the fair-value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates , inflation or currency risks ( 201cstructured liabilities 201d ) .\n27 the following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value: .\n28 citigroup also holds various non-strategic investments in leveraged buyout funds and other hedge funds that previously were required to be accounted for under the equity method .\n29 thus , this fair-value election had no impact on opening retained earnings .\n30 certain non-structured liabilities the company has elected the fair-value option for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates ( 201cnon-structured liabilities 201d ) . .\n31 as required by sfas 159 , all investments ( debt and equity ) in such private

due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments .\n2 conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease .\n3 if our long- term debt ratings were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase .\n4 changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility .\n5 we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively .\n6 interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year .\n7 interest on the senior notes is

as of may 31 , 2016 and significant endorsement contracts , including related marketing commitments , entered into through the date of this report are as follows: .\n10 as of may 31 , 2016 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future .\n11 however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations .\n12 we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively .\n13 liquidity is also provided by our $ 2 billion commercial paper program , which increased $ 1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 .\n14 in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable .\n15 as of may 31 , 2016 , we had cash , cash equivalents and

million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity .\n23 we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future .\n24 future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets .\n25 should we require additional

indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings .\n36 on october 29 , 2015 , we issued an additional $ 1.0 billion of senior notes at a 3.875% ( 3.875 % ) fixed , annual interest rate that will mature on november 1 , 2045 .\n37 the 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 500 million at a 2.25% ( 2.25 % ) fixed , annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 , 2023 .\n38 the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 500

the closing date , provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 , 2022 .\n40 off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor .\n41 currently , we have several such agreements in place .\n42 taxes less applicable foreign tax credits .\n43 if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s .\n44 taxes have previously been provided .\n45 to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs .\n46 our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk .\n47 government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities .\n48 treasury obligations , u.s

outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .\n4 we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .\n5 the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months , nine months and twelve months after the modification date .\n6 our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal .\n7 during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest .\n8 a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification .\n9 typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .\n10 permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .\n11 a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .\n12 see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information .\n13 loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate .\n14 additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .\n15 examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .\n16 for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .\n17 residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months .\n18 we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses .\n19 78 the pnc financial services group , inc .\n20 ( a ) includes approximately $ 306 million , $ 44 million , $ 60 million , $ 100 million , and $ 246 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments with draw periods scheduled to end in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 and thereafter , respectively .\n21 at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr .\n22 if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .\n23 permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .\n24 generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20 year amortization term .\n25 temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs .\n26 generally , when a borrower becomes 60

4.0 billion at both december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 .\n3 the reserve for losses under these programs totaled $ 47 million and $ 54 million as of december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , respectively , and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet .\n4 pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the whole-loans sold in these transactions .\n5 recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 3 loan sale and servicing activities and

securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions with continuing involvement .\n6 change in assumption ( a ) estimated increase to 2012 pension expense ( in millions ) .\n7 if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses .\n8 as discussed in note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with fnma , fhlmc , and the government national mortgage association ( gnma ) program , while non-agency securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors .\n9 under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement .\n10 these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements .\n11 one form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets in these transactions .\n12 our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment .\n13 also , current law , including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan .\n14 the table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions , using 2012 estimated expense as a baseline .\n15 investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years .\n16 we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc .\n17 our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc , as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with federal housing agency ( fha ) and department of veterans affairs ( va ) -insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal .\n18 pnc 2019s repurchase obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition .\n19 residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and whole-loan sale transactions .\n20 repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines/loans are reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment .\n21 ( a ) the impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant .\n22 residential mortgage loan and home equity repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis , we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors .\n23 loan covenants and representations and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that pnc has sold loans to the pnc financial services group , inc .\n24 repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment .\n25 commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate , close , and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s delegated underwriting and servicing ( dus ) program .\n26 we do not expect to be required by law to make any contributions to the plan during 2012 .\n27 2013 form 10-k 69 .\n28 we maintain a reserve for estimated losses based on our exposure .\n29 we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results , including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees .\n30 our

$ 852 million in 2009 , and $ 926 million in 2008 .\n2 investing activities capital expenditures 2013 the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments .\n3 the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009 , and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009 .\n4 we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure .\n5 ( in millions ) 2010 2009 2008 .\n6 the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $ 1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $ 147 million .\n7 the increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $ 570 million as discussed below , and $ 187 million related to lower net income tax payments , as compared to 2009 .\n8 of the shares we repurchased in 2010 , 0.9 million shares for $ 63 million were repurchased in december but settled and were paid for in january 2011 .\n9 cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 totaled $ 59 million , $ 40 million , and $ 250 million .\n10 in october 2010 , our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time , up to an authorized amount of $ 3.0 billion ( see note 12 ) .\n11 partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million .\n12 this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $ 758 million as compared to 2009 , partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts .\n13 we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years .\n14 the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities .\n15 we repurchased a total of 11.2 million shares under the program for $ 776 million , and as of december 31 , 2010 , there remained $ 2224 million available for additional share repurchases .\n16 partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined

we paid $ 435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities , compared with $ 233 million in 2008 .\n20 these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009 .\n21 under the program , we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation .\n22 the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments .\n23 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 374 million to $ 3547 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 .\n24 amounts paid in 2010 of $ 148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates .\n25 operating working capital accounts consists of receivables , inventories , accounts payable , and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred .\n26 during 2010 , we increased our short-term investments by $ 171 million compared to an increase of $ 279 million in 2009 .\n27 the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics , partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems .\n28 the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems , is&gs , and space systems business areas .\n29 there were no material divestiture activities in 2009 and 2008 .\n30 net cash provided

last three years : in millions 2005 2004 2003 .\n2 segment operating profit ( in millions ) .\n3 results of operations industry segment operating profits are used by international paper 2019s management to measure the earn- ings performance of its businesses .\n4 industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure , and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states .\n5 additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and container- board .\n6 in- dustry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest , interest expense , corporate items and corporate special items .\n7 management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper 2019s operating results in 2005 were strongly impacted by significantly higher costs for en- ergy , wood , caustic soda and other raw materials which reduced operating profits compared with 2004 by $ 586 million .\n8 industry segment operating profits were $ 117 mil- lion lower in 2005 due principally to the impact of higher energy and raw material costs ( $ 586 million ) , lower sales volume ( $ 251 million ) , and unfavorable for- eign currency translation rates ( $ 27 million ) which more than offset the benefits from higher average prices ( $ 478 million ) , cost reduction initiatives , improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ( $ 235 million ) , and higher earnings from land sales ( $ 158 million ) .\n9 the impact of divestitures ( $ 32 million ) , principally the fine papers and industrial pa- pers businesses , and other items ( $ 36 million ) also had a negative impact in 2005 .\n10 looking forward to 2006 , we expect operating prof- its for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter .\n11 uncoated paper and containerboard mills , and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in po- land and russia to add needed uncoated paper and pa- perboard capacity .\n12 lower sales volumes were also a negative factor versus 2004 as we took a significant amount of lack-of-order downtime in our u.s .\n13 we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that , if the trend continues , should benefit operations as the year pro- gresses .\n14 management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs , operating efficiencies , prices and volumes .\n15 sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter , but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses .\n16 we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger , and that we will realize 2005 fourth-quarter and 2006 first-quarter announced price increases .\n17 international paper operates in six segments : print- ing papers , industrial packaging , consumer packaging , distribution , forest products , and specialty businesses and other .\n18 we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations , im- proved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades , a more favorable product mix , and higher earn- ings from forestland and real estate sales .\n19 while energy , wood and raw material price movements are mixed , their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat .\n20 * special items include restructuring and other charges , net losses on sales and impair- ments of businesses held for sale , insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no lon- ger required .\n21 in connection with our overall strategic direction , we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spin-off of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan , with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 .\n22 we also will con- tinue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill oper- ations to reduce costs , improve our products and im- prove our overall profitability .\n23 however , we see favorable signs of positive mo- mentum for the remainder of 2006 .\n24 price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are im- plemented .\n25 item 7 .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was the change in industry

fair value of the remaining .\n2 the decline in these remaining after-tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from december 31 , 2010 to december 31 , 2011 resulted primarily from amortization .\n3 to the extent that such factors differ substantially from management 2019s current expectations , resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated .\n4 the credit component is recorded in our consolidated statement of income , and the non-credit component is recorded in oci to the extent that we do not intend to sell the security .\n5 overall , management 2019s expectation , for purposes of its evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment as of december 31 , 2011 , was that housing prices would decline by approximately 35% ( 35 % ) peak-to-trough .\n6 to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations , other-than-temporary impairment could increase , in particular , the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income .\n7 given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio , particularly mortgage- and asset-backed securities , to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks , the performance of the u.s .\n8 as of september 30 , 2011 , national housing prices , according to the case-shiller national home price index , had declined by approximately 31.3% ( 31.3 % ) peak-to-current .\n9 the net unrealized amounts presented above excluded the remaining net unrealized losses related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity .\n10 the combination of these factors has led to an increase in management 2019s overall loss expectations .\n11 these unrealized losses related to reclassifications totaled $ 303 million , or $ 189 million after-tax , and $ 523 million , or $ 317 million after-tax , as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively , and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income , or oci .\n12 to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified , the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component .\n13 refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 .\n14 this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors , including , but not limited to , the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults .\n15 generally , indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears .\n16 in addition , we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non-agency u.s .\n17 the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages of securities continues to deteriorate .\n18 we estimate , for example , that other-than-temporary impairment of the investment portfolio could increase by approximately $ 10 million to $ 50 million , if national housing prices were to decline by 37% ( 37 % ) to 39% ( 39 % ) peak-to-trough , compared to management 2019s expectation of 35% ( 35 % ) described above .\n19 in addition , management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above .\n20 housing market is a significant driver of the portfolio 2019s credit performance .\n21 as such , our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices .\n22 our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to management 2019s estimates of future cumulative losses .\n23 impairment the following table presents net unrealized losses on securities available for sale as of december 31: .\n24 ultimately , other-than- temporary impairment is based on specific cusip-level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security .\n25 our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation , more fully described in note 3 , of economic and security-specific factors .\n26 we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists .\n27 residential mortgage-backed portfolio .\n28 such factors are based on estimates , derived by management , which contemplate

well-capitalized position , based upon tier 1 and total capital ratios at december 31 , 2008 and 2007 , as indicated in the tables below .\n3 the occ granted jpmorgan chase bank , n.a .\n4 the office of the comptroller of the currency ( 201cocc 201d ) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firm 2019s national banks , including jpmorgan chase bank , n.a. , and chase bank usa , n.a .\n5 based on the provisions of the current proposal and the firm 2019s interpretation of the propos- al , the firm estimates that the impact of consolidation could be up to $ 70 billion of credit card receivables , $ 40 billion of assets related to firm-sponsored multi-seller conduits , and $ 50 billion of other loans ( including residential mortgages ) ; the decrease in the tier 1 capital ratio could be approximately 80 basis points .\n6 / 2008 annual report 83 credit risk capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale business- es ( ib , cb , tss and am ) and consumer businesses ( rfs and cs ) .\n7 in addition to negative market fluctua- tions , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk .\n8 market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari- ables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , securities prices and commodities prices .\n9 private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately and publicly held securities , third-party fund investments and commitments in the private equity portfolio to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations .\n10 credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and declines in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .\n11 the operational risk capital model is based upon actual losses and potential scenario-based stress losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment or the use of risk-transfer prod- ucts .\n12 operational risk capital capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera- tional risk on a bottom-up basis .\n13 risk-based capital components and assets .\n14 unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained .\n15 similar relief from its risk-based capital and leverage requirements .\n16 regulatory capital the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( the 201cfederal reserve 201d ) establishes capital requirements , including well-capitalized standards for the consolidated financial holding company .\n17 statistical results for certain segments or portfolios are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench- marks , such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital held at representative monoline competitors , where appropriate .\n18 credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon product and other relevant risk segmentation .\n19 daily value-at-risk ( 201cvar 201d ) , biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine appropriate capital levels .\n20 the firm allocates market risk capital to each business segment according to a formula that weights that seg- ment 2019s var and stress-test exposures .\n21 the capital methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation .\n22 the capital allocation for the private equity portfolio is based upon measurement of the loss experience suffered by the firm and other market participants over a prolonged period of adverse equity market conditions .\n23 the federal reserve granted the firm , for a period of 18 months fol- lowing the bear stearns merger , relief up to a certain specified amount and subject to certain conditions from the federal reserve 2019s risk-based capital and leverage requirements with respect to bear stearns 2019 risk-weighted assets and other exposures acquired .\n24 the ulti- mate impact could differ

of customer annuities .\n8 lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction .\n9 the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) .\n10 trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level ,

interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries .\n14 all payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in

management , after consultation with legal counsel , currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability , if any , arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on blackrock 2019s results of operations , financial position , or cash flows .\n31 federal , state governmental and domestic and international regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings .\n32 indemnifications .\n33 it is blackrock 2019s policy to cooperate fully with such inquiries .\n34 from time to time , blackrock receives

and about $ 55 million from the nasa external tank program , which ended in connection with the completion of the space shuttle program in 2011. .\n5 the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $ 150 million due to increased commercial satellite deliveries ( two commercial satellites delivered in 2012 compared to one during 2011 ) ;

retirement or termination .\n19 we have deferred benefit arrangements with certain key officers and employees that provide participants with an annual payment , payable when the participant attains a certain age and after the participant 2019s employment has terminated .\n20 in addition , we maintain defined contribution plans in various foreign countries and contributed $ 25.0 , $ 28.7 and $ 26.7

the security .\n3 to the extent that other-than-temporary impairment is identified , the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non-credit component .\n4 the decline in these remaining after-tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from december 31 , 2010 to december 31 , 2011 resulted primarily from amortization .\n5 these unrealized losses related to reclassifications

comprehensive income , or oci .\n6 this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors , including , but not limited to , the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults .\n7 housing market is a significant driver of the portfolio 2019s credit performance .\n8 given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio , particularly mortgage- and asset-backed securities , to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks , the performance of the u.s .\n9 to the extent that market conditions are worse than management 2019s expectations , other-than-temporary impairment could increase , in particular , the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income .\n10 the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages of securities continues to deteriorate .\n11 ultimately , other-than- temporary impairment is based on specific cusip-level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security .\n12 generally , indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears .\n13 our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment involves an evaluation , more fully described in note 3 , of economic and security-specific factors .\n14 as of september 30 , 2011 , national housing prices , according to the case-shiller national home price index , had declined by approximately 31.3% ( 31.3 % ) peak-to-current .\n15 the combination of these factors has led to an increase in management 2019s overall loss expectations .\n16 in addition , we perform sensitivity analysis across

that housing prices would decline by approximately 35% ( 35 % ) peak-to-trough .\n18 such factors are based on estimates , derived by management , which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance .\n19 in addition , management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above .\n20 as such , our assessment of other-than-temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices .\n21 the net unrealized amounts presented above excluded the remaining net unrealized losses related to

table presents net unrealized losses on securities available for sale as of december 31: .\n24 to the extent that such factors differ substantially from management 2019s current expectations , resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated .\n25 we estimate , for example , that other-than-temporary impairment of the investment portfolio could increase by approximately $ 10 million to $ 50 million , if national housing prices were to decline by 37% ( 37 % ) to 39% ( 39 % ) peak-to-trough , compared to management 2019s expectation of 35% ( 35 % ) described above .\n26

transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income .\n3 these items have been classified appropriately in trading account assets or trading account liabilities on the consolidated

the fair- value option , because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis .\n18 the fair-value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of certain of these investments .\n19 the company has elected the fair-value option for certain of these ventures , because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in our investment companies , which are reported at fair value .\n20 significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term , or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party .\n21 citigroup has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications .\n22 other items for which the fair-value option was selected in accordance with sfas 159 the company has elected the fair-value option for the following eligible items , which did not affect opening retained earnings : 2022 certain credit products ; 2022 certain investments in private equity and real estate ventures and certain equity-method investments ; 2022 certain structured liabilities ; 2022 certain non-structured liabilities ; and 2022 certain mortgage loans certain credit products citigroup has elected the fair-value option for certain originated and purchased loans , including certain unfunded loan products , such as guarantees and letters of credit , executed by citigroup 2019s trading businesses

private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation .\n28 thus , this fair-value election had no impact on opening retained earnings

$ 852 million in 2009 , and $ 926 million in 2008 .\n2 investing activities capital expenditures 2013 the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments .\n3 the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009 , and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009 .\n4 the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $ 1373 million as compared to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $ 147 million .\n5 ( in millions ) 2010 2009 2008 .\n6 we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure .\n7 we paid $ 435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities , compared with $ 233 million in 2008 .\n8 partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million .\n9 cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 totaled $ 59 million , $ 40 million , and $ 250 million .\n10 the increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $ 570 million as discussed below , and $ 187 million related to lower net income tax payments , as compared to 2009 .\n11 there were no material divestiture activities in 2009 and 2008 .\n12 of the shares we repurchased in 2010 , 0.9 million shares for $ 63 million were repurchased in december but settled and were paid for in january 2011 .\n13 financing activities share activity and dividends 2013 during 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 , we repurchased 33.0 million , 24.9 million , and 29.0 million shares of our common stock for $ 2483 million , $ 1851 million , and $ 2931 million .\n14 this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $ 758 million as compared to 2009 , partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts .\n15 we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years .\n16 the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities .\n17 partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan .\n18 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1248 million to $ 3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 .\n19 in october 2010 , our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time , up to an authorized amount of $ 3.0 billion ( see note 12 ) .\n20 under the program , we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation .\n21 the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments .\n22 we repurchased a total of 11.2 million shares under the program for $ 776 million , and as of december 31 , 2010 , there remained $ 2224 million available for additional share repurchases .\n23 in 2010 , we received proceeds of $ 798 million from the sale of eig , net of $ 17 million in transaction costs ( see note 2 ) .\n24 operating working capital accounts consists of receivables , inventories , accounts payable , and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred .\n25 the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics , partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems .\n26 the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems , is&gs , and space systems business areas .\n27 these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009 .\n28 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 374 million to $ 3547 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 .\n29 acquisitions , divestitures and other activities 2013 acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates .\n30 those activities resulted in the issuance of 1.4 million shares , 1.0 million shares , and 4.7 million shares during the respective periods. .\n31 during 2010 , we increased our short-term investments by $ 171 million compared to an increase of $ 279 million in 2009 .\n32 amounts paid in 2010 of $ 148 million

initiative that identified areas where we can operate more efficiently , resulting in a reduction of approximately $ 900 million in annual run rate compensation .\n2 the table below presents our operating expenses and total staff ( which includes employees , consultants and temporary staff ) . .\n3 discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by , among other factors , the level of net revenues , overall financial performance , prevailing labor markets , business mix , the structure of our share- based compensation programs and the external environment .\n4 investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 7.03 billion for 2015 , 9% ( 9 % ) higher than 2014 , due to significantly higher revenues in financial advisory , reflecting strong client activity , particularly in the u.s .\n5 this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from investments in equities , principally reflecting the sale of metro international trade services ( metro ) in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net gains from investments in private equities , driven by corporate performance .\n6 net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $ 3.06 billion for 2015 , 24% ( 24 % ) lower than 2014 .\n7 in addition , revenues in debt securities and loans were significantly lower , reflecting lower net gains from investments .\n8 net interest income .\n9 the decrease compared with 2014 was due to lower interest income resulting from a reduction in interest income related to financial instruments owned , at fair value , partially offset by the impact of an increase in total average loans receivable .\n10 for 2016 , net savings from this initiative , after severance and other related costs , were approximately $ 500 million .\n11 commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 3.32 billion for 2015 , essentially unchanged compared with 2014 .\n12 excluding a gain of $ 289 million in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt , market-making revenues were 18% ( 18 % ) higher than 2014 , reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products , currencies , equity cash products and equity derivatives .\n13 other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 5.02 billion for 2015 , 24% ( 24 % ) lower than 2014 .\n14

.\n17 investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 5.87 billion for 2015 , 2% ( 2 % ) higher than 2014 , due to slightly higher management and other fees , primarily reflecting higher average assets under supervision , and higher transaction revenues .\n18 revenues in underwriting were lower compared with a strong 2014 .\n19 see 201csupplemental financial information 2014 statistical disclosures 2014 distribution of assets , liabilities and shareholders 2019 equity 201d for further information about our sources of net interest income .\n20 the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense , which primarily reflected lower interest expense related to financial instruments sold , but not yet purchased , at fair value and other interest-bearing liabilities , partially offset by higher interest expense related to long-term borrowings .\n21 in addition , see 201cuse of estimates 201d for additional information about expenses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings .\n22 industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions increased significantly compared with the prior year .\n23 revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared with 2014 , reflecting significantly lower leveraged finance activity .\n24 these increases were partially offset by significantly lower revenues in mortgages , commodities and credit products .\n25 revenues in equity underwriting were also lower , reflecting significantly lower revenues from initial public offerings and convertible offerings , partially offset by significantly higher revenues from secondary offerings .\n26 operating expenses our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation , headcount and levels of business

key assumptions , and the sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to adverse changes in those key assumptions for the years ended december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , during which period msrs were accounted for under sfas year ended december 31 , ( in millions ) 2007 2006 .\n2 hedge effectiveness was assessed using a regression analysis of the change in fair value of the msrs as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates and of the change in the fair value of the designated derivatives .\n3 during the fourth quarter of the 2007 , the firm 2019s proprietary prepayment model was refined to reflect a decrease in estimated future mortgage prepay- ments based upon a number of market related factors including a downward trend in home prices , general tightening of credit under- writing standards and the associated impact on refinancing activity .\n4 this caption also represents total realized and unrealized gains ( losses ) included in net income per the sfas 157 disclosure for fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) .\n5 in designat- ing the benchmark interest rate , the firm considered the impact that the change in the benchmark rate had on the prepayment speed esti- mates in determining the fair value of the msrs .\n6 these changes in fair value are recorded in mortgage fees and related income. .\n7 these changes in fair value are recorded in mortgage fees and related income .\n8 this amount was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 , 2006 .\n9 sfas 133 hedge accounting allowed the carrying value of the hedged msrs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives was recognized through earnings .\n10 msrs are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value , and changes in their fair value are recorded in current- period earnings .\n11 the designated hedge period was daily .\n12 the firm reassesses and periodi- cally adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market par- ticipant would consider in valuing the msr asset .\n13 the intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of msrs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments .\n14 the valua- tion adjustments to both the msrs and sfas 133 derivatives were recorded in mortgage fees and related income .\n15 / 2007 annual report 155 flows at risk-adjusted rates .\n16 change in unrealized ( losses ) gains included in income related to msrs held at december 31 $ ( 516 ) na ( a ) represents msr asset fair value adjustments due to changes in market-based inputs , such as interest rates and volatility , as well as updates to assumptions used in the msr valuation model .\n17 revenue amounts related to msrs and the financial instruments used to manage the risk of msrs are recorded in mortgage fees and related income .\n18 in march 2006 , the fasb issued sfas 156 , which permits an entity a one-time irrevocable election to adopt fair value accounting for a class of servicing assets .\n19 jpmorgan chase elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 , 2006 , and defined msrs as one class of servicing assets for this election .\n20 any indicated impairment was rec- ognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation allowance , which represented the extent to which the carrying value of an individual stra- tum exceeded its estimated fair value .\n21 under this approach , msrs were amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans .\n22 for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of msrs , the firm stratified the portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics , which are loan type and interest rate .\n23 msrs decrease in value when interest rates decline .\n24 jpmorgan chase uses or has used combinations of derivatives , afs securities and trading instru- ments to manage changes in the fair value of msrs .\n25 the firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience .\n26 ( b ) includes changes in the msr value due to modeled servicing portfolio runoff ( or time decay ) .\n27 the fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates , includ- ing their effect on prepayment speeds .\n28 any gross carrying value and relat- ed valuation allowance amounts which were not expected to be recov- ered in the foreseeable future , based upon the interest rate scenario , were considered to be other-than-temporary .\n29 conversely , securities ( such as mort- gage-backed securities ) , principal-only certificates and certain deriva- tives ( when the firm receives fixed-rate interest payments ) increase in value when interest rates decline .\n30 the model considers portfolio characteris- tics , contractually specified servicing fees , prepayment assumptions , delinquency rates , late charges , other ancillary revenue and costs to service , and other economic factors .\n31 prior to the adoption of sfas 156 , the firm designated certain deriva- tives used to risk manage msrs ( e.g. , a combination of swaps , swap- tions and floors ) as sfas 133 fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk .\n32 at the transition date , the fair value of the msrs exceeded their carrying amount , net of any related valuation allowance , by $ 150 million net of taxes .\n33 this caption represents the impact of cash settlements per the sfas 157 disclosure for fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) .\n34 with the election to apply fair value accounting to the msrs under sfas 156 , sfas 133 hedge accounting is no longer necessary .\n35 for a further discussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities , see note 30 on pages 168 2013169 of this annual report .\n36 for the year ended december 31 , 2005 , msrs were accounted for under sfas 140 , using a lower of cost or fair value approach .\n37 jpmorgan chase & co .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was the difference in total additions between 2006 and 2007 in millions?\n\n\n\n### Response", "resp": "The answer is:

initiative that identified areas where we can operate more efficiently , resulting in a reduction of approximately $ 900 million in annual run rate compensation .\n6 this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from investments in equities , principally reflecting the sale of metro international trade services ( metro ) in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net gains from investments in private equities , driven by corporate performance .\n7 commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 3.32 billion for 2015 , essentially unchanged compared with 2014 .\n8

derivatives .\n14 investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 5.87 billion for 2015 , 2% ( 2 % ) higher than 2014 , due to slightly higher management and other

f0b7 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets ; f0b7 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices ; and f0b7 expected salvage to be received upon retirement .\n8 rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material .\n9 the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites , as well as ongoing monitoring costs , but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties .\n10 for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track .\n11 we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies .\n12 we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics , use , and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes , and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates .\n13 each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers .\n14 property and depreciation 2013 our railroad operations are highly capital intensive , and our large base of homogeneous , network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis .\n15 the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources , not as singular items .\n16 we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes , and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology , asset strategies , or other factors .\n17 properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives , which are measured in years , except for rail in high-density traffic corridors ( i.e. , all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment , yard and switching tracks , and electronic yards ) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track .\n18 for all other depreciable assets , we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives .\n19 assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria .\n20 estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal , state , and local laws governing environmental remediation .\n21 the service lives also vary based on rail weight , rail condition ( e.g. , new or secondhand ) , and rail type ( e.g. , straight or curve ) .\n22 current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations , financial condition , or liquidity .\n23 cost estimates are based on information available for each site , financial viability of other potentially responsible parties , and existing technology , laws , and regulations .\n24 we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ( i.e. , rail and other track material , ties , and ballast ) and other road property .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nin 2013 what was the percentage of the sites closed down\n\n\n\n### Response", "resp": "The answer is: 0.21269"}, {"id": "DVN/2014/page_85.pdf-2", "user_prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a question answering task in the finance domain, paired with an input table and its relevant text that provide further context.

analysis of the change in fair value of the msrs as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates and of the change in the fair value of the designated derivatives .\n2 in designat- ing the benchmark interest rate , the firm considered the impact that the change in the benchmark rate had on the prepayment speed esti- mates in determining the fair value of the msrs .\n3 the intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of msrs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments .\n4 sfas 133 hedge accounting allowed the carrying value of the hedged msrs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives was recognized through earnings .\n5 the following table summarizes msr activity , certain key assumptions , and the sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to adverse changes in those key assumptions for the years ended december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , during which period msrs were accounted for under sfas year ended december 31 , ( in millions ) 2007 2006 .\n6 msrs are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value , and changes in their fair value are recorded in current- period earnings .\n7 during the fourth quarter of the 2007 , the firm 2019s proprietary prepayment model was refined to reflect a decrease in estimated future mortgage prepay- ments based upon a number of market related factors including a downward trend in home prices , general tightening of credit under- writing standards and the associated impact on refinancing activity .\n8 change in unrealized ( losses ) gains included in income related to msrs held at december 31 $ ( 516 ) na ( a ) represents msr asset fair value adjustments due to changes in market-based inputs , such as interest rates and volatility , as well as updates to assumptions used in the msr valuation model .\n9 these changes in fair value are recorded in mortgage fees and related income. .\n10 these changes in fair value are recorded in mortgage fees and related income .\n11 at the transition date , the fair value of the msrs exceeded their carrying amount , net of any related valuation allowance , by $ 150 million net of taxes .\n12 any indicated impairment was rec- ognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation allowance , which represented the extent to which the carrying value of an individual stra- tum exceeded its estimated fair value .\n13 under this approach , msrs were amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans .\n14 the fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates , includ- ing their effect on prepayment speeds .\n15 the designated hedge period was daily .\n16 jpmorgan chase uses or has used combinations of derivatives , afs securities and trading instru- ments to manage changes in the fair value of msrs .\n17 revenue amounts related to msrs and the financial instruments used to manage the risk of msrs are recorded in mortgage fees and related income .\n18 for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of msrs , the firm stratified the portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics , which are loan type and interest rate .\n19 msrs decrease in value when interest rates decline .\n20 prior to the adoption of sfas 156 , the firm designated certain deriva- tives used to risk manage msrs ( e.g. , a combination of swaps , swap- tions and floors ) as sfas 133 fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk .\n21 the valua- tion adjustments to both the msrs and sfas 133 derivatives were recorded in mortgage fees and related income .\n22 the firm reassesses and periodi- cally adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market par- ticipant would consider in valuing the msr asset .\n23 / 2007 annual report 155 flows at risk-adjusted rates .\n24 this caption represents the impact of cash settlements per the sfas 157 disclosure for fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) .\n25 in march 2006 , the fasb issued sfas 156 , which permits an entity a one-time irrevocable election to adopt fair value accounting for a class of servicing assets .\n26 with the election to apply fair value accounting to the msrs under sfas 156 , sfas 133 hedge accounting is no longer necessary .\n27 for the year ended december 31 , 2005 , msrs were accounted for under sfas 140 , using a lower of cost or fair value approach .\n28 ( b ) includes changes in the msr value due to modeled servicing portfolio runoff ( or time decay ) .\n29 this amount was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 , 2006 .\n30 this caption also represents total realized and unrealized gains ( losses ) included in net income per the sfas 157 disclosure for fair value measurement using significant unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) .\n31 any gross carrying value and relat- ed valuation allowance amounts which were not expected to be recov- ered in the foreseeable future , based upon the interest rate scenario , were considered to be other-than-temporary .\n32 jpmorgan chase elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 , 2006 , and defined msrs as one class of servicing assets for this election .\n33 the firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience .\n34 conversely , securities ( such as mort- gage-backed securities ) , principal-only certificates and certain deriva- tives ( when the firm receives fixed-rate interest payments ) increase in value when interest rates decline .\n35 the model considers portfolio characteris- tics , contractually specified servicing fees , prepayment assumptions , delinquency rates , late charges , other ancillary revenue and costs to service , and other economic factors .\n36 for a further discussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities , see note 30 on pages 168

contractual obligations as of december 31 , 2004 , is as follows: .\n2 as a result of the long-term nature of this facility , the commercial paper and credit line borrowings are now classified as long-term debt .\n3 our leverage , as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization , was 32 percent at the end of 2004 and the end of 2003 .\n4 to take advantage of historically low long-term borrowing rates , we issued $ 50.0 million in senior notes with two insurance companies in june 2003 .\n5 reducing working capital is one of our major initiatives in 2005 .\n6 additionally , receivable balances were $ 21.2 million higher due to price increases associated with new product introductions in our water systems business and an increase in international sales , which tend to have longer payment terms .\n7 the $ 33.9 million increase in 2004 reflects $ 44.9 million higher receivable balances due to longer payment terms experienced by both of our businesses as well as higher sales levels in the fourth quarter .\n8 our working capital , excluding short-term debt , was $ 339.8 million at december 31 , 2004 , compared with $ 305.9 million and $ 225.1 million at december 31 , 2003 , and december 31 , 2002 , respectively .\n9 the $ 80.8 million increase in 2003 reflects $ 46.6 million higher inventory balances due primarily to extensive manufacturing repositioning in our electric motor business and several new product introductions and manufacturing consolidation in our water systems business .\n10 the proceeds of the notes were used to repay commercial paper and borrowing under the credit facility .\n11 we believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future .\n12 table of contents item 7 2013 management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources we recorded net earnings of $ 35.4 million or $ 1.18 per share in 2004 , compared with $ 52.2 million or $ 1.76 per share recorded in 2003 and $ 51.3 million or $ 1.86 per share in 2002 .\n13 net earnings recorded in 2004 were negatively impacted by cost increases to steel and freight , as well as manufacturing inefficiencies during the first nine months of the year in our ashland city plant and higher selling , general and administrative expense ( sg&a ) .\n14 we believe that our present facilities and planned capital expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in 2005 .\n15 we are projecting 2005 capital expenditures to be approximately $ 55 million , essentially the same as our projected 2005 depreciation expense .\n16 at december 31 , 2004 , we had available borrowing capacity of $ 153.9 million under this facility .\n17 in june 2004 , we completed a $ 265 million , five-year revolving credit facility with a group of eight banks .\n18 despite lower earnings in 2004 , a smaller investment in working capital explains the majority of the improvement in cash flow compared with 2003 .\n19 the notes range in maturity between 2013 and 2016 and carry a weighted average interest rate of slightly less than 4.5 percent .\n20 while net earnings were flat in 2003 compared with 2002 , the lower earnings per share amount in 2003 as compared with 2002 reflected the full-year impact of our stock offering in may 2002 .\n21 the higher investment in working capital in 2003 ( as discussed above ) , explains the majority of the difference between 2003 and our capital expenditures were $ 48.5 million in 2004 , essentially the same as in 2003 and approximately $ 2.2 million higher than in 2002 .\n22 .\n23 the new facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings .\n24 the new facility expires on june 10 , 2009 , and it replaced a $ 250 million credit facility which expired on august 2 , 2004 , and was terminated on june 10 , 2004 .\n25 the increase in 2003 was associated with new product launches in our water systems business .\n26 cash provided by operating activities during 2004 was $ 67.2 million compared with $ 29.0 million during 2003 and $ 116.0 million during 2002 .\n27 finally , a $ 13.1 million increase in accounts payable balances was largely offset by $ 9.4 million in restructuring expenses paid out in 2003 .\n28 offsetting the increase in receivable balances were $ 13.5 million lower inventory levels split about equally between water systems and electrical products and $ 14.3 million higher accounts payable balances .\n29 our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat percentage of total

of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report .\n3 higher net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth .\n4 also contributing to the positive variance was a $ 234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares .\n5 the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio .\n6 lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction .\n7 2007 compared with 2006 total net revenue of $ 71.4 billion was up $ 9.4 billion , or 15% ( 15 % ) , from the prior year .\n8 finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities .\n9 trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments .\n10 the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) .\n11 the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services .\n12 asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 .\n13 increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results .\n14 record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees .\n15 also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities .\n16 factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment than they are in this consolidated sec- tion .\n17 tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody .\n18 for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report .\n19 ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from

the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements .\n2 we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 .\n3 prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years .\n4 this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n5 the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s .\n6 a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate .\n7 for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions .\n8 the following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and the impact of prior period development on our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio for the periods indicated. .\n9 the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix .\n10 refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information .\n11 the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources .\n12

catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike .\n14 our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions .\n15 although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 .\n16 our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations .\n17 the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business .\n18 internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail .\n19 our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n20 the catastrophe losses for 2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe .\n21 with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent ( mga ) relating to the previous crop year ( s ) in subsequent calendar quarters and this typically results .\n22 the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments .\n23 administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses .\n24 administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business .\n25 esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 .\n26 the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm .\n27 our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates .\n28 our

realizations were significantly lower as the decline in demand resulted in significant price declines for market pulp and smaller declines in fluff pulp .\n20 in the first quarter of 2010 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , reflecting improving customer demand for fluff pulp , offset by slightly seasonally weaker demand for softwood and hard- wood pulp in china .\n21 benefits from higher average sales price realizations ( $ 114 million ) , lower raw material and energy costs ( $ 114 million ) , lower freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , lower costs associated with the reorganiza- tion of the shorewood business ( $ 23 million ) , favor- able foreign exchange effects ( $ 14 million ) and other items ( $ 12 million ) were partially offset by lower sales volumes and increased lack-of-order downtime ( $ 145 million ) and costs associated with the perma- nent shutdown of the franklin mill ( $ 67 million ) .\n22 operating earnings increased slightly in 2009 compared

2007 .\n25 raw material costs for wood , energy and chemicals were significantly lower in 2009 , while freight costs were also favorable .\n26 excluding alternative fuel mixture credits and facility closure costs , 2009 operating profits were sig- nificantly higher than 2008 and 57% ( 57 % ) higher than 2007 .\n27 input costs are expected to be higher due to wood supply constraints at the kwidzyn mill and annual tariff increases on energy in russia .\n28 operating costs , however , were unfavorable and planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher .\n29 operating profits increased significantly compared with both 2008 and 2007 .\n30 planned maintenance downtime costs will be higher , but operating costs should be about flat .\n31 input costs are expected to increase for wood , energy and chemicals , and freight costs may also increase .\n32 mill operating costs were favorable across all mills , and planned maintenance downtime costs were lower .\n33 input costs for wood , energy and chemicals decreased , and freight costs were significantly lower .\n34 u.s .\n35 planned main- tenance outage costs are expected to be about flat , while operating costs should be favorable

segment operating profits are used by international paper 2019s management to measure the earn- ings performance of its businesses .\n3 industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure , and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states .\n4 the following table shows the components of net earnings ( loss ) for each of the last three years : in millions 2005 2004 2003 .\n5 management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper 2019s operating results in 2005 were strongly impacted by significantly higher costs for en- ergy , wood , caustic soda and other raw materials which reduced operating profits compared with 2004 by $ 586 million .\n6 industry segment operating profits were $ 117 mil- lion lower in 2005 due principally to the impact of higher energy and raw material costs ( $ 586 million ) , lower sales volume ( $ 251 million ) , and unfavorable for- eign currency translation rates ( $ 27 million ) which more than offset the benefits from higher average prices ( $ 478 million ) , cost reduction initiatives , improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ( $ 235 million ) , and higher earnings from land sales ( $ 158 million ) .\n7 additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and container- board .\n8 in- dustry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest , interest expense , corporate items and corporate special items .\n9 the impact of divestitures ( $ 32 million ) , principally the fine papers and industrial pa- pers businesses , and other items ( $ 36 million ) also had a negative impact in 2005 .\n10 looking forward to 2006 , we expect operating prof- its for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter .\n11 we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger , and that we will realize 2005 fourth-quarter and 2006 first-quarter announced price increases .\n12 uncoated paper and containerboard mills , and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in po- land and russia to add needed uncoated paper and pa- perboard capacity .\n13 lower sales volumes were also a negative factor versus 2004 as we took a significant amount of lack-of-order downtime in our u.s .\n14 we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that , if the trend continues , should benefit operations as the year pro- gresses .\n15 management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs , operating efficiencies , prices and volumes .\n16 sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter , but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses .\n17 international paper operates in six segments : print- ing papers , industrial packaging , consumer packaging , distribution , forest products , and specialty businesses and other .\n18 we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations , im- proved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades , a more favorable product mix , and higher earn- ings from forestland and real estate sales .\n19 while energy , wood and raw material price movements are mixed , their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat .\n20 * special items include restructuring and other charges , net losses on sales and impair- ments of businesses held for sale , insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no lon- ger required .\n21 in connection with our overall strategic direction , we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spin-off of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan , with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 .\n22 we also will con- tinue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill oper- ations to reduce costs , improve our products and im- prove our overall profitability .\n23 however , we see favorable signs of positive mo- mentum for the remainder of 2006 .\n24 price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are im- plemented .\n25 item 7 .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was

as discussed in item 8 , note 13 .\n10 these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs .\n11 to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method .\n12 benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) .\n13 since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets .\n14 at december 31 , 2018 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.2 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics .\n15 the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2018 .\n16 for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience .\n17 for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made .\n18 we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s .\n19 if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired .\n20 we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so .\n21 gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods .\n22 the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value .\n23 the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s .\n24 the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million .\n25 to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry .\n26 if our review indicates that inventories of raw materials , components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value , we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations .\n27 we concluded that the fair value of our non- amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value .\n28 management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use .\n29 these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates .\n30 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation -

million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments with draw periods scheduled to end in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 and thereafter , respectively .\n2 based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2011 , the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end .\n3 residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months .\n4 home equity lines of credit - draw period end dates in millions interest only product principal and interest product .\n5 a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification .\n6 a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .\n7 during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest .\n8 permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .\n9 we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .\n10 additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .\n11 generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20 year amortization term .\n12 see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information .\n13 based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .\n14 examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .\n15 we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses .\n16 typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .\n17 for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .\n18 the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months , nine months and twelve months after the modification date .\n19 initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program .\n20 at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr .\n21 if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .\n22 permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .\n23 our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal .\n24 temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs .\n25 78 the pnc financial services group , inc .\n26 further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs .\n27 loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate .\n28 2013 form 10-k

was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions .\n3 we recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 366 million in 2010 compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 137 million and $ 567 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n4 prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years .\n5 the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s .\n6 the catastrophe losses for 2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe .\n7 the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm .\n8 the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix .\n9 our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n10 the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources .\n11 the following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and the impact of prior period development on our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio for the periods indicated. .\n12 our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations .\n13 our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions .\n14 although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 .\n15 with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent ( mga ) relating to the previous crop year ( s ) in subsequent calendar quarters and this typically results .\n16 esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 .\n17 prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life segment , of $ 512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements .\n18 administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business .\n19 the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business .\n20 this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n21 we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 .\n22 our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 .\n23 a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate .\n24 internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail .\n25 our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates .\n26 the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments .\n27 administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses .\n28 our policy

jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s .\n2 we recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 366 million in 2010 compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $ 137 million and $ 567 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n3 for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions .\n4 the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm .\n5 the catastrophe losses for 2010 were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe .\n6 esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 .\n7 administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses .\n8 for 2008 , the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike .\n9 we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 .\n10 although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 .\n11 our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions .\n12 the following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and the impact of prior period development on our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio for the periods indicated. .\n13 prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years .\n14 our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations .\n15 our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 .\n16 the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business .\n17 administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business .\n18 this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n19 our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .\n20 the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix .\n21 a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate .\n22 prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life segment , of $ 512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements .\n23 the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments .\n24 internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail .\n25 our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates .\n26 with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent ( mga ) relating to the previous crop year ( s ) in subsequent calendar quarters and this typically results .\n27 our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium .\n28 the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources .\n29 administrative expenses include all other operating costs .\n30 refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nby what amount have catastrophic losses in 2010 surpass the

interest product .\n2 during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest .\n3 we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .\n4 ( a ) includes approximately $ 306 million , $ 44 million , $ 60 million , $ 100 million , and $ 246 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments with draw periods scheduled to end in 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , and 2016 and thereafter , respectively .\n5 residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months .\n6 based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2011 , the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end .\n7 a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification .\n8 generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20 year amortization term .\n9 based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .\n10 typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .\n11 see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information .\n12 for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .\n13 examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .\n14 the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months , nine months and twelve months after the modification date .\n15 additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .\n16 a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .\n17 permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .\n18 we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses .\n19 our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal .\n20 permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .\n21 initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program .\n22 generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated .\n23 temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs .\n24 78 the pnc financial services group , inc .\n25 further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs .\n26 if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .\n27 loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate .\n28 2013 form 10-k .\n29 at that point , we continue

was $ 105 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity .\n3 while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2016 , the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 91 days .\n4 we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future .\n5 during the year ended may 31 , 2016 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2016 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program .\n6 cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks , money market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s .\n7 as of may 31 , 2016 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future .\n8 as of and for the periods ended may 31 , 2016 and 2015 , we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility .\n9 estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts , applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of may 31 , 2016 ( if variable ) , timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations. .\n10 contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2016 and significant endorsement contracts , including related marketing commitments , entered into through the date of this report are as follows: .\n11 we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed .\n12 ( 1 ) the cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments .\n13 we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s .\n14 these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth .\n15 should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt .\n16 interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year .\n17 interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year .\n18 in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable .\n19 off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor .\n20 we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings .\n21 on april 23 , 2013 , we issued $ 1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043 .\n22 taxes less applicable foreign tax credits .\n23 the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 500 million at a 3.625% ( 3.625

interest rate and will mature on may 1 , 2023 .\n25 we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec in july 2016 .\n26 the issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $ 991 million .\n27 if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s .\n28 however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations .\n29 the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $ 998 million .\n30 the shelf expired on april 23 , 2016 .\n31 we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively .\n32 we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively .\n33 changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility .\n34 liquidity is also provided by our $ 2 billion commercial paper program , which increased $ 1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 .\n35 on august 28 , 2015 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks , which provides for up to $ 2 billion of borrowings .\n36 future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets .\n37 currently , we have several such agreements in place .\n38 the facility matures august 28 , 2020 , with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date , provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 , 2022 .\n39 all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk .\n40 if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense .\n41 any future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs .\n42 our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk .\n43 on october 29 , 2015 , we issued an additional $ 1.0 billion of senior notes at a 3.875% ( 3.875 % ) fixed , annual interest rate that will mature on november 1 , 2045 .\n44 government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities .\n45 part ii capital resources on april 23 , 2013 , we filed a shelf registration statement ( the 201cshelf 201d ) with the sec which permitted us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities .\n46 conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease .\n47 if our long- term debt ratings were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase .\n48 taxes have previously been provided .\n49 to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs .\n50 treasury obligations , u.s .\n51 under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants .\n52 this facility replaces the

notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of our foreign pension plan assets measured at fair value that used significant unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) ( in millions ) : .\n3 tax on certain off-shore earnings referred to as global intangible low-taxed income ( gilti ) at an effective tax rate of 10.5 percent for tax years beginning after december 31 , 2017 ( increasing to 13.125 percent for tax years beginning after december 31 , 2025 ) , with a partial offset by foreign tax credits ; and 2022 the introduction of a territorial tax system beginning in 2018 by providing a 100 percent dividend received deduction on certain qualified dividends from foreign subsidiaries .\n4 the 2017 tax act contains several key provisions including , among other things : 2022 a one-time tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits ( e&p ) , referred to as the toll charge ; 2022 a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after december 31 , 2022 the introduction of a new u.s .\n5 the net benefit recorded was based on currently available information and interpretations made in applying the provisions of the 2017 tax act as of the time of filing this annual report on form 10-k .\n6 we do not expect the assets in any of our plans to be returned to us in the next year .\n7 2022 an income tax benefit of $ 557.4 million , primarily related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the enacted corporate income tax rate of 21 percent .\n8 we will continue to analyze the 2017 tax act and any additional guidance that may be issued so we can finalize the full effects of applying the new legislation on our financial statements in the measurement period , which ends in the fourth quarter of 2018 .\n9 tax basis differences in the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries , and our ability to offset any tax with foreign tax credits .\n10 during the fourth quarter of 2017 , we recorded an income tax benefit of $ 1272.4 million , which was comprised of the following : 2022 income tax benefit of $ 715.0 million for the one-time deemed repatriation of foreign earnings .\n11 in accordance with the 2017 tax act , we expect to elect to pay the toll charge in installments over eight years .\n12 this is composed of a $ 1181.0 million benefit from the removal of a deferred tax liability we had recorded for the repatriation of foreign earnings prior to the 2017 tax act offset by $ 466.0 million for the toll charge recognized under the 2017 tax act .\n13 the 2017 tax act includes a broad range of provisions , many of which significantly differ from those contained in previous u.s .\n14 in addition , we are still evaluating the gilti provisions of the 2017 tax act and their impact , if any , on our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 , 2017 .\n15 the benefits offered under these plans are reflective of local customs and practices in the countries concerned .\n16 contributions to foreign defined benefit plans are estimated to be $ 17.0 million in 2018 .\n17 and puerto rico employees and certain employees in other countries .\n18 in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the sec , the income tax effect for certain aspects of the 2017 tax act represent provisional amounts for which our accounting is incomplete , but with respect to which a reasonable estimate could be determined and recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 .\n19 we expect that we will have no legally required minimum funding requirements in 2018 for the qualified u.s .\n20 we further refined our estimates related to the impact of the 2017 tax act subsequent to the issuance of our earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2017 .\n21 we have not yet determined which accounting policy to adopt because determining the impact of the gilti provisions requires analysis of our existing legal entity structure , the reversal of our u.s .\n22 the fasb allows companies to adopt an accounting policy to either recognize deferred taxes for

provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009 , and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009 .\n4 the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on

assumption while holding all other assumptions constant .\n5 pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the whole-loans sold in these transactions .\n6 if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses .\n7 these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements .\n8 as discussed in note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with fnma , fhlmc , and the government national mortgage association ( gnma ) program , while non-agency securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors .\n9 recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 3 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , pnc has

affected negatively by a sudden and unanticipated increase in short-term rates paid on its liabilities ( e.g. , depos- its ) without a corresponding increase in long-term rates re- ceived on its assets ( e.g. , loans ) .\n2 for example , if more deposit liabilities are repricing than assets when general interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially .\n3 earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change in the firm 2019s net interest income , and the corresponding impact to the firm 2019s pretax earnings , over the following 12 months .\n4 2022 the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets , liabili- ties or off 2013balance sheet instruments as interest rates change .\n5 for example , if more borrowers than forecasted pay down higher-rate loan balances when general interest rates are de- clining , earnings may decrease initially .\n6 jpmorgan chase 2019s 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profile as of december 31 , 2009 and 2008 , is as follows. .\n7 conversely , higher long-term rates received on assets generally are beneficial to earnings , particularly when the increase is not accompanied by rising short-term rates paid on liabilities .\n8 the change in earnings at risk from december 31 , 2008 , results from a higher level of afs securities and an updated baseline scenario that uses higher short-term interest rates .\n9 for example , if liabilities reprice quicker than assets and funding interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially .\n10 2022 differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change ( for example , changes in the slope of the yield curve , because the firm has the ability to lend at long-term fixed rates and borrow at variable or short- term fixed rates ) .\n11 the increase in earnings is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates , with funding costs remaining unchanged .\n12 jpmorgan chase & co./2009 annual report 131 earnings-at-risk stress testing the var and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of the firm 2019s consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables .\n13 these tests highlight exposures to various rate-sensitive factors , such as the rates themselves ( e.g. , the prime lending rate ) , pricing strate- gies on deposits , optionality and changes in

target rate of zero , and negative three- and six-month treasury rates .\n15 business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury through a transfer- pricing system , which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets .\n16 interest rate risk exposure in the firm 2019s core nontrading business activities ( i.e. , asset/liability management positions ) results from on 2013and off 2013balance sheet positions and can occur due to a variety of factors , including : 2022 differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments .\n17 limits reflect the firm 2019s risk appetite in the context of the market environment and business strategy .\n18 the firm 2019s risk to rising rates is largely the result of increased funding costs on assets , partially offset by widening deposit margins , which are currently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates .\n19 additionally , another interest rate scenario , involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 100 basis points and short- term rates staying at current levels , results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of $ 449 million .\n20 2022 differences in the amounts of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments that are repricing at the same time .\n21 these scenarios include the implied forward curve , nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates .\n22 the effect of interest rate exposure on reported net income is also important .\n23 immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk , and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed .\n24 the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated , corporate-wide basis .\n25 the firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income from its nontrading activities under a variety of interest rate scenarios .\n26 in setting limits , the firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility , product liquidity , business trends and management experience. .\n27 the earnings- at-risk results of such a low-probability scenario are not meaningful .\n28 management of trading businesses control rifle entries , thereby permitting the firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not

special items of $ 35.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 21.2 , special termination benefits of $ 8.7 , and curtailment losses of $ 5.3 .\n3 2015 pension expense , excluding special items , decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost , the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains , partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans .\n4 this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation .\n5 pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 15 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements .\n6 ( a ) effective in 2016 , the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows , as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs .\n7 2017 outlook in 2017 , pension expense , excluding special items , is estimated to be approximately $ 70 to $ 75 , an increase of $ 10 to $ 15 from 2016 , resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates , offset by favorable asset experience , effects of the versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables .\n8 with the assistance of third party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions .\n9 2014 the decrease in pension expense , excluding special items , was due to the impact from expected return on assets , a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption , and lower service cost and interest cost .\n10 the loss will be reflected in the results from discontinued operations on the consolidated income statements .\n11 the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses , which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate .\n12 future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017 .\n13 the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans , which .\n14 2016 vs .\n15 in 2017 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 164

funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans .\n25 these resulted primarily from our recent

their contracts ) are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which the counterparties 2019 obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties .\n5 relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 29 , 2011 and october 30 , 2010 , a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $ 6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows .\n6 $ ( 13332 ) $ ( 7396 ) the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the u.s .\n7 the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months .\n8 our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. .\n9 the effect of the swap is to convert our 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) fixed

foreign currency exchange contracts .\n11 based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 29 , 2011 , we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them .\n12 as of october 30 , 2010 , a similar 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in an increase of approximately $ 4 million to our annual interest expense .\n13 however , this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our $ 375 million of 3% ( 3 % ) fixed-rate debt , which is not hedged .\n14 the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings .\n15 in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates , such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors 2019 products become more or less attractive .\n16 the following table illustrates the effect that a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates , relative to the u.s .\n17 the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions , assets and liabilities being hedged .\n18 in addition , we have a term loan facility of $ 145 million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% ( 1.25 % ) ( 1.61% ( 1.61 % ) as of october 29 , 2011 ) .\n19 while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions , they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk .\n20 foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k , we regularly hedge our non-u.s .\n21 currently , our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro , primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses .\n22 we hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $ 375 million 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) senior unsecured notes due july 1 , 2014 .\n23 dollar .\n24 .\n25 .\n26 .\n27 .\n28

350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan .\n9 amounts paid in 2010 of $ 148 million primarily related to investments in affiliates .\n10 the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at

to 2008 and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of $ 147 million .\n17 the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments .\n18 this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $ 758 million as compared to 2009 , partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts .\n19 under the program , we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation .\n20 we paid $ 435 million in 2009 for acquisition activities , compared with $ 233 million in 2008 .\n21 during 2010 , we increased our short-term investments by $ 171 million compared to an

that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years .\n24 in october 2010 , our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time-to-time , up to an authorized amount of $ 3.0 billion ( see note 12 ) .\n25 acquisitions , divestitures and other activities 2013

december 31 , 2010 , there remained $ 2224 million available for additional share repurchases .\n27 the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics , partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems .\n28 in connection with their approval of the new share repurchase program , our board terminated our previous share repurchase program .\n29 there were no material divestiture activities in 2009 and 2008 .\n30 operating working capital accounts consists of receivables , inventories , accounts payable , and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred .\n31 financing activities share

maintained a well-capitalized position , based upon tier 1 and total capital ratios at december 31 , 2008 and 2007 , as indicated in the tables below .\n3 the operational risk capital model is based upon actual losses and potential scenario-based stress losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment or the use of risk-transfer prod- ucts .\n4 based on the provisions of the current proposal and the firm 2019s interpretation of the propos- al , the firm estimates that the impact of consolidation could be up to $ 70 billion of credit card receivables , $ 40 billion of assets related to firm-sponsored multi-seller conduits , and $ 50 billion of other loans ( including residential mortgages ) ; the decrease in the tier 1 capital ratio could be approximately 80 basis points .\n5 market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari- ables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , securities prices and commodities prices .\n6 operational risk capital capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera- tional risk on a bottom-up basis .\n7 / 2008 annual report 83 credit risk capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale business- es ( ib , cb , tss and am ) and consumer businesses ( rfs and cs ) .\n8 credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon product and other relevant risk segmentation .\n9 the capital allocation for the private equity portfolio is based upon measurement of the loss experience suffered by the firm and other market participants over a prolonged period of adverse equity market conditions .\n10 the federal reserve granted the firm , for a period of 18 months fol- lowing the bear stearns merger , relief up to a certain specified amount and subject to certain conditions from the federal reserve 2019s risk-based capital and leverage requirements with respect to bear stearns 2019 risk-weighted assets and other exposures acquired .\n11 regulatory capital the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( the 201cfederal reserve 201d ) establishes capital requirements , including well-capitalized standards for the consolidated financial holding company .\n12 the firm allocates market risk capital to each business segment according to a formula that weights that seg- ment 2019s var and stress-test exposures .\n13 private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately and publicly held securities , third-party fund investments and commitments in the private equity portfolio to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations .\n14 similar relief from its risk-based capital and leverage requirements .\n15 the office of the comptroller of the currency ( 201cocc 201d ) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firm 2019s national banks , including jpmorgan chase bank , n.a. , and chase bank usa , n.a .\n16 ( a ) the fasb has been deliberating certain amendments to both sfas 140 and fin 46r that may impact the accounting for transactions that involve qspes and vies .\n17 credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and declines in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .\n18 the ulti- mate impact could differ significantly due to the fasb 2019s continuing deliberations on the final requirements of the rule and market conditions. .\n19 the capital methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation .\n20 statistical results for certain segments or portfolios are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench- marks , such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital held at representative monoline competitors , where appropriate .\n21 in addition to negative market fluctua- tions , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk .\n22 the amount of such relief is subject to reduction by one-sixth each quarter subsequent to the merger and expires on october 1 , 2009 .\n23 daily value-at-risk ( 201cvar 201d ) , biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine appropriate capital levels .\n24 the firm believes its model is consistent with the new basel ii framework .\n25 see market risk management on pages 111 2013116 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures .\n26 unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained .\n27 the occ granted jpmorgan chase bank , n.a .\n28 for more information , see note 30 on pages 212 2013213 of this annual report .\n29 actual segment level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .\n30 jpmorgan chase & co .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nin 2008 what was the percent of the total capital risk based

4.9 bil- lion in 2006 , and 13% ( 13 % ) compared with $ 4.6 billion in 2005 .\n5 industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products .\n6 sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year .\n7 in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix .\n8 average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 .\n9 sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes .\n10 in addition , a gain of $ 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of $ 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard .\n11 the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy , chemicals and freight .\n12 bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) .\n13 converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand .\n14 operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by $ 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine .\n15 looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 .\n16 the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was market-related .\n17 earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 .\n18 operating profits in 2007 were $ 407 million , up from $ 327 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 170 million in 2005 .\n19 operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 .\n20 operating earnings in 2007 were $ 104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 .\n21 entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly .\n22 average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 , principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp .\n23 entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues .\n24 operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings .\n25 favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs .\n26 containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 , including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 .\n27 conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs .\n28 manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages .\n29 profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .\n30 manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter .\n31 however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy .\n32 u.s .\n33 raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly .\n34 margins improved reflecting stronger export demand .\n35 however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages .\n36 tissue pulp due to strong market demand , partic- ularly from asia .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat percentage of industrial packaging sales

average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp .\n18 in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix .\n19 sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes .\n20 entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be

costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) .\n25 entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly .\n26 manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter .\n27 conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs .\n28 favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs .\n29 however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy .\n30 profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .\n31 u.s .\n32 raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly .\n33 margins improved

paper 2019s management to measure the earn- ings performance of its businesses .\n2 industry segment operating profits were $ 117 mil- lion lower in 2005 due principally to the impact of higher energy and raw material costs ( $ 586 million ) , lower sales volume ( $ 251 million ) , and unfavorable for- eign currency translation rates ( $ 27 million ) which more than offset the benefits from higher average prices ( $ 478 million ) , cost reduction initiatives , improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ( $ 235 million ) , and higher earnings from land sales ( $ 158 million ) .\n3 the following table shows the components of net earnings ( loss ) for each of the last three years : in millions 2005 2004 2003 .\n4 industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure , and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states .\n5 looking forward to 2006 , we expect operating prof- its for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter .\n6 segment operating profit ( in millions ) .\n7 we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations , im- proved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades , a more favorable product mix , and higher earn- ings from forestland and real estate sales .\n8 in- dustry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest , interest expense , corporate items and corporate special items .\n9 additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and container- board .\n10 management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper 2019s operating results in 2005 were strongly impacted by significantly higher costs for en- ergy , wood , caustic soda and other raw materials which reduced operating profits compared with 2004 by $ 586 million .\n11 the impact of divestitures ( $ 32 million ) , principally the fine papers and industrial pa- pers businesses , and other items ( $ 36 million ) also had a negative impact in 2005 .\n12 we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that , if the trend continues , should benefit operations as the year pro- gresses .\n13 while energy , wood and raw material price movements are mixed , their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat .\n14 sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter , but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses .\n15 uncoated paper and containerboard mills , and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in po- land and russia to add needed uncoated paper and pa- perboard capacity .\n16 we also will con- tinue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill oper- ations to reduce costs , improve our products and im- prove our overall profitability .\n17 management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs , operating efficiencies , prices and volumes .\n18 we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger , and that we will realize 2005 fourth-quarter and 2006 first-quarter announced price increases .\n19 however , we see favorable signs of positive mo- mentum for the remainder of 2006 .\n20 in connection with our overall strategic direction , we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spin-off of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan , with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 .\n21 * special items include restructuring and other charges , net losses on sales and impair- ments of businesses held for sale , insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no lon- ger required .\n22 international paper operates in six segments : print- ing papers , industrial packaging , consumer packaging , distribution , forest products , and specialty businesses and other .\n23 price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are im- plemented .\n24 lower sales volumes were also a negative factor versus 2004 as we took a significant amount of lack-of-order downtime in our u.s .\n25 item 7 .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was the

f0b7 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets ; f0b7 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices ; and f0b7 expected salvage to be received upon retirement .\n9 each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers .\n10 our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives .\n11 we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes , and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology , asset strategies , or other factors .\n12 rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material .\n13 for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track .\n14 we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies .\n15 we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics , use , and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes , and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates .\n16 properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives , which are measured in years , except for rail in high-density traffic corridors ( i.e. , all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment , yard and switching tracks , and electronic yards ) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track .\n17 the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources , not as singular items .\n18 for all other depreciable assets , we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives .\n19 assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria .\n20 current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations , financial condition , or liquidity .\n21 the service lives also vary based on rail weight , rail condition ( e.g. , new or secondhand ) , and rail type ( e.g. , straight or curve ) .\n22 cost estimates are based on information available for each site , financial viability of other potentially responsible parties , and existing technology , laws , and regulations .\n23 property and depreciation 2013 our railroad operations are highly capital intensive , and our large base of homogeneous , network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis .\n24 we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ( i.e. , rail and other track material , ties , and ballast ) and other road property .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2011 to 2012?\n\n\n\n### Response", "resp": "The answer is: -1.0"}, {"id": "UNP/2014/page_35.pdf-4", "user_prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a question answering task in the finance domain, paired with an input table and its relevant text that provide further context.

were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment .\n2 shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 .\n3 foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 .\n4 coated paperboard net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2006 were higher than $ 1.3 billion in 2005 and $ 1.1 billion in 2004 .\n5 average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 .\n6 operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices .\n7 sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products .\n8 sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 .\n9 consumer packaging in millions 2006 2005 2004 .\n10 sales volumes for u.s .\n11 operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 .\n12 operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs .\n13 an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter .\n14 earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2006 .\n15 shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix .\n16

price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board .\n20 in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 .\n21 the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight .\n22 raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste .\n23 average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january .\n24 manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills .\n25 foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume .\n26 in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix .\n27 costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase .\n28 however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix .\n29 distribution our distribution business , principally represented by our xpedx business , markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in .\n30 compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix ( $ 14 million ) and other costs ( $ 21 million ) .\n31 consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity .\n32 average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages .\n33 containerboard export sales volumes are expected to decline due to scheduled first-quarter main- tenance outages .\n34 converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease .\n35 euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs .\n36 it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable

millions 2006 2005 2004 .\n2 consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity .\n3 sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment .\n4 consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 .\n5 in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix .\n6 an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter .\n7 operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs .\n8 earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2006 .\n9 foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 .\n10 operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 .\n11 sales volumes increased in 2006 compared with 2005 , particularly in the folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products .\n12 sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 .\n13 coated paperboard net sales of $ 1.5 billion in 2006 were higher than $ 1.3 billion in 2005 and $ 1.1 billion in 2004 .\n14 entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols .\n15 average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 .\n16 operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices .\n17 the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight .\n18 in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 .\n19 manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills .\n20 average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board .\n21 shorewood sales volumes for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to seasonally decline , but the earnings impact will be partially offset by pricing improvements and an improved product mix .\n22 shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 .\n23 foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume .\n24 average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january .\n25 converted products will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease .\n26 raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste .\n27 however , sales price realizations will be slightly higher , and the seasonal switch to hot cup contain- ers will have a favorable impact on product mix .\n28 distribution our distribution business , principally represented by our xpedx business , markets a diverse array of products and supply chain services to customers in .\n29 it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter .\n30 compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix ( $ 14 million ) and other costs ( $ 21 million ) .\n31 operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels .\n32 euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs .\n33 costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase .\n34 average sales price real- izations are

f0b7 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets ; f0b7 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices ; and f0b7 expected salvage to be received upon retirement .\n9 each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers .\n10 our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives .\n11 we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes , and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology , asset strategies , or other factors .\n12 rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material .\n13 for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track .\n14 we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies .\n15 we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics , use , and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes , and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates .\n16 properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives , which are measured in years , except for rail in high-density traffic corridors ( i.e. , all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment , yard and switching tracks , and electronic yards ) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track .\n17 property and depreciation 2013 our railroad operations are highly capital intensive , and our large base of homogeneous , network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis .\n18 the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources , not as singular items .\n19 for all other depreciable assets , we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives .\n20 assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria .\n21 current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations , financial condition , or liquidity .\n22 the service lives also vary based on rail weight , rail condition ( e.g. , new or secondhand ) , and rail type ( e.g. , straight or curve ) .\n23 cost estimates are based on information available for each site , financial viability of other potentially responsible parties , and existing technology , laws , and regulations .\n24 we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ( i.e. , rail and other track material , ties , and ballast ) and other road property .\n\n\n\n\n### Question \n\nwhat was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2012 to 2013?\n\n\n\n### Response", "resp": "The answer is: -16.0"}, {"id": "IP/2007/page_31.pdf-4", "user_prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a question answering task in the finance domain, paired with an input table and its relevant text that provide further context.

millions 2007 2006 2005 .\n2 european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 1.1 billion , up from $ 1.0 billion in 2006 and $ 880 million in 2005 .\n3 north american industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 3.9 billion , compared with $ 3.7 billion in 2006 and $ 3.6 billion in 2005 .\n4 industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6% ( 6 % ) to $ 5.2 billion compared with $ 4.9 bil- lion in 2006 , and 13% ( 13 % ) compared with $ 4.6 billion in 2005 .\n5 industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products .\n6 sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year .\n7 profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .\n8 in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix .\n9 in addition , a gain of $ 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of $ 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard .\n10 operating profits in 2007 were $ 407 million , up from $ 327 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 170 million in 2005 .\n11 operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 .\n12 operating earnings in 2007 were $ 104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 .\n13 containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 , including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 .\n14 average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 .\n15 operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings .\n16 the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was market-related .\n17 earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 .\n18 looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 .\n19 manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages .\n20 operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by $ 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine .\n21 entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues .\n22 manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter .\n23 conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs .\n24 the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy , chemicals and freight .\n25 converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand .\n26 entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly .\n27 average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 , principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp .\n28 however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy .\n29 bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) .\n30 sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes .\n31 favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs .\n32 u.s .\n33 raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly .\n34 margins improved reflecting stronger export demand .\n35 however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned
